The country's jokes often touch on numerous issues, including the norms associated with Nigerians, poverty, language, and so much more. Which are some of the top funny Nigerian jokes today? Mr Macaroni, a famous Nigerian comedian and actor, shares insights into the global impact of social media on humor and other comedic styles.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/9f38eccf2069494e.jpeg><h2 class=table-of-contents__title>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h2><p class=align-left>Like in other countries, most Nigerian <a href=#>jokes are predicated</a> on the aspects that define Nigeria's <a href=#>people</a>, institutions, leadership, economic status, and history.</p><p class=align-left>In a recent conversation with Legit.ng, Adebowale David Ibrahim Adedayo, better known as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mr. Macaroni</a>, a prominent Nigerian comedian, actor, and activist, highlighted the role of social media in empowering comedians to create and share content, promoting connections with audiences worldwide. He said:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/513a33905e881444.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Hardship: Primary school pupil tackles Tinubu, other Nigerian leaders during debate, video trends</span></p></a>For creators like myself, it gave us a platform. When social media came in, it was like an art, an avenue to express my talent and prove myself. These social media platforms have helped in projecting that. For a platform like TikTok, shorter videos do very well; they're shorter in portrait mode. People want a quick laugh, 30 seconds, 15 seconds. They want to see that and move on to the following creator. The YouTube community loves longer entertaining content. The YouTube audience mostly wants to relax at home, somewhere in the office when they have a 15-minute break, or what have you; they want to watch. I've understood the different platforms and used them to the advantage of growing the Mr. Macaroni Entertainment brand.<h2 id=1126524-collaboration-in-nigerian-comedy class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Collaboration in Nigerian comedy</h2><p class=align-left>Mr Macaroni also emphasized the importance of collaboration among comedy content creators, adding that it displays each individual's elements and uniqueness. He explained:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/115327a65b0a77eb.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Online images reinforce gender stereotypes more than text: study</span></p></a>So, instead of competition, the best thing is coming together to create fantastic content for the audience. You will be shocked that some people who don't enjoy Creator A's content when you collaborate now see something special about Creator A or Creator B or C, and they say, "This person is not bad; I enjoyed the performance in 'so-so' content."There will be some people, members of the audience, that don't maybe like <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mr Macaroni's content</a>, but when they see him on maybe <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Broda Shaggi's content </a>or <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kiekie's content</a>, they say, "I enjoyed him there," and that way they come to my page, and they say, "Wow, okay, it's not bad." While some see other people on our content and say, "Wow." So it can only be a plus, not a minus; that's collaboration. It brings different people and creators together and projects them more.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/cdee7b53227a8b53.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"Made in Kaduna": Talented shoemaker produces beautiful shoes that look like expensive Timberland</span></p></a>There are some creators I have more reach than, and some have more reach than me.

Then, suddenly, he sees the lion praying as well! He gets relieved and tells the lion, "I didn't know you're a believer as well. I'm so glad. For a moment, I thought that you might eat me."

They got Lacoste sleeping bags."</li><li>A man is on a photo safari in Nigeria. He finds an elephant in distress, lying in the bushes. Upon inspection, he finds that the elephant has a large, sharp rock embedded in the bottom of its foot. He carefully pulls the rock free, and the elephant gets up and saunters away. A decade later, he is back in his hometown when a circus is visiting, and they put on a parade. As the man is watching all the animals go past, he notices and makes eye contact with a large African elephant. The elephant immediately turns toward the man, picks him up in its trunk, slams him on the pavement, and then stomps the life out of him. It was a different elephant.</li><li>A policeman is praying at a church, and a priest comes to him! "Priest, tell me, son, who killed Abel?"

The first guy unwraps his meal, looks at it, and nervously looks at his friend and asks, "which part did you get?"</li><li>Using a public toilet without a lock is extreme sports; whenever you hear footsteps, you must either sing, clear your throat, or use your leg to wedge the door shut so that they know you are inside.</li><li>Walking through the jungles of Nigeria, a man comes across a pygmy standing next to a ferocious dead lion. So, the man approaches the pygmy and asks him, "Did you kill that lion?" "Yes", says the pygmy, "I killed it with my club." Impressed by the tiny fellow, the man exclaims, "Wow!

These jokes touch on numerous Nigerian issues ranging from the country's diverse culture to its somewhat unenviable economic situation.</p><h2 id=1126524-tips-from-expert class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Tips from expert</h2><p class=align-left>Mr Macaroni also discussed jokes that appeal to a broad audience and topics that may be sensitive due to the diverse tribal landscape in Nigeria. He said:</p>I'm very conscious about how my art is presented because of my theater background. I believe that drama should not only seek to entertain, but it must inform, educate, and be used as a tool to reform and rejuvenate society. I'm always conscious of the content I create, the meanings, and the gigantic lessons it carries. Who are we creators if we cannot show what is happening in our environment? Society presents the raw materials for every artist and every creator to create his art. You best believe that whatever you see on any creator show reflects society. Sometimes, of course, it's exaggerated, there is much hyperbole, and then there are different elements that we infuse in the contents to present the satire or, in some instances, just for comedic purposes; there's art for art's sake, I just want to make you laugh, and that's it. For some creators, that's fine.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/a5a247f908e5dc63.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What your favourite colour says about you: interesting facts</span></p></a>As a creator, I am very particular about using my content to reflect society and show the state of things and that they can be better. I use my content to address the people and manage the leadership; we all can do better.And, of course, some topics are susceptible and must not be toyed with, topics such as sexual assault; they are touchy topics; you just have to be very careful about them. So basically, if I am creating content about sexual assault, it is directed at just one purpose: to die it, to speak against it, and to let people know that there have to be consequences for actions.But when creating these things, you have to be very careful because you know that there are victims who have suffered from these things, and you might just trigger something. And, of course, I always try to balance my content out. What's on top of my mind is dignity and respect, and that as a people, we must share these traits: love. So, when I'm creating content, I know that I want to entertain you, but at the same time, I want to teach you and awaken your consciousness, and you can only do that by putting out thoughtful content.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/fb69a4bc48fd46e0.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>60+ The Lorax quotes from the Dr. Seuss’ famous franchise</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When discussing his comedic influences, Mr. Macaroni revealed that he has no favorite comedian. Instead, he attributed his comedic style to the drama roles he performed in school. He said:</p>As far as influence in comedic presentation is concerned, it's from school and the fantastic stories, the place that we performed – "Lottery Ticket," "Our Husbands Have Gone Mad Again"... many unique literary pieces with lots of comedy inside them. And of course, that's not to say there are no comedians whose work I don't love. For comedy, I watch stand-up, and I'm a huge fan of stand-up.<p class=align-left><strong>NOTE</strong>: these jokes are meant for entertainment and to celebrate the humor in Nigerian culture.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>20 best black female comedians you should be on the lookout for</a></p><p class=align-left>Legit.ng recently published an article about the 20 best <a href=#>black female comedians</a>.
