Her unique disease is expressed by the fact that Lizzie, whose weight today is just over 25 kilograms (60 pounds) with a height of 152 cm, has 0% of body fat. She must constantly maintain her fragile food life. So, the metabolism in her body forces the girl to eat up to 60 times a day, otherwise, not receiving food every 15 minutes, Lizzie can simply die.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/11c465c39dfb4c4c.jpg><p class=align-left>Photo from healthactu.files.wordpress.com</p><p class=align-left>It is known that there are three people like her in the whole world, Velazquez names others women suffering from a strange disease - Amanda from Britain, who is about 38 years old, and 23-year-old Abigail, who also lives in Austin.

So, the thinnest waist in the world, which was fixed by the Guinness Book of Records specialists in the early twentieth century, belonged to a resident of England named Ethel Granger.</p><p class=align-left>The spouse of the woman admired such detail of a female toilet as a corset. Ethel satisfied her husband and enjoyed wearing it, and took off literally just for the night. Moreover, every day Granger pulled down her waist harder and harder. As a result, the waist gradually grew thin and became only 33 centimeters. Such a waist can be wrapped with two hands. By the way, the record was reported in 1939. And since then, women with a smaller waist size have not been found.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2d07dfb081c30ce0.jpg><p class=align-left>Picture from pix.avaxnews.com</p><p class=align-left>However, another happy owner of the wasp waist from the past is a resident of France named Emily Marie-Bouchard. She was an actress and more known to the public under the pseudonym Poehler. Her pride is the thinnest waist in the world with the same parameters as the previous record holder namely 33 centimeters. The result of her corset efforts helped the woman both on stage and in life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/44ec301170d718d8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The amazing story of Lina Medina, the youngest mother in the world, will impress you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>There are also women whose waist volume is striking among contemporaries. So, the American Cathie Jung has the title "The thinnest waist in the world these days". And this is not a young girl. Record holder for the eighth decade. And at this age, the circumference of her waist is 38 centimeters. These numbers are not even close to the vast majority of women on the planet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/64df786e14c000b6.jpg><p class=align-left>Photo from pix.avaxnews.com</p><p class=align-left>By the way, Cathie Jung has achieved such staggering results for a long 45 years. And the incentive was quite primitive. At one time, the American watched the film "Gone With the Wind" and decided to please her spouse with a constant wearing of a corset, which makes the figure slimmer, and the posture impeccable.</p><p class=align-left>It is worth noting that owner of the thinnest waist in the world is the mother of three children. Her waist size was 64 centimeters by the age of 28. After this result, Cathie began to wear a corset every day. It not only emphasized the thin waist of the woman but also made it even thinner every day. Its volume gradually began to decrease centimeter by centimeter. When the size reached 38.1 centimeters - the record was officially registered in the Guinness Book of Records.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/459c4b7614ca6b14.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nollywood actresses with unique physique: most beautiful Nigerian women</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/00731abf12f62456.png><p class=align-left>Source of the picture: pix.avaxnews.com</p><p class=align-left>The proportions of Cathie Jung are very unusual 99-38-99.
