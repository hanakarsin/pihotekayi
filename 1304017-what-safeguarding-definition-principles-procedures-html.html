What are the 6 principles of child safeguarding? Here is a definitive analysis of this concept in relation to children.</p><h2>What does safeguarding mean?</h2><p class=align-left>The word<i> safeguard </i>originated from late Middle English, which means safe-conduct or protection. In Old French, the term is known as <i>sauve garde</i>. If translated in English, <i>Sauve</i> means 'safe' while <i>garde </i>means '<i>guard</i>.'</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4e41500687c7cfaa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is enmeshment in a relationship and how does one deal with it?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The definition of safeguarding varies depending on the institution.

These principles apply to all categories of vulnerable people, including children. They are as follows:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6899cbff1ace36c5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Internet for teenagers: discover the pros and cons</span></p></a><ul><li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> Under this principle, you are supposed to empower all vulnerable individuals in society. You can encourage them to make their own decisions by explaining to them the basics of informed consent.</li><li><strong>Proportionality: </strong>This principle requires that all factors are taken into consideration before coming up with a solution. The solution should be made to fit the problem.</li><li><strong>Prevention: </strong>Measures that reduce the likelihood of harm, abuse, and neglect are at the core of safeguarding practices. It is better to take action before maltreatment occurs.</li><li><strong>Protection:</strong> Every caregiver should be ready to offer the required support to vulnerable people. They should be well informed about when, why and how to offer protection.</li><li><strong>Partnership: </strong>Protection is a collective responsibility. It should encompass local solutions by working with the communities in which the vulnerable people live in. In other words, communities have an obligation as far as detecting, preventing, and responding to abuse and neglect is concerned.</li><li><strong>Accountability: </strong>When it comes to keeping children safe, all the stakeholders involved should act with a high level of transparency and accountability.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/12f679af69dcc65d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best discipline quotes to motivate you each morning</span></p></a><h2>Why is safeguarding for children important?</h2><p class=align-left>Children are vulnerable members of society. Given their age, they cannot protect or defend themselves from harm or abuse. They need advocates who can act on their behalf. Below are a few reasons why it is important to define safeguarding and ensure its implementation:</p><ul><li><i>Child abuse, neglect, and harm are wrong.</i> It is the duty of society as a whole to ensure that it does not happen to any child. Remember, children's safety is a collective responsibility.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c10f1ee88d9f337d.jpg><ul><li><i>Every child is vulnerable to harassment, abuse, and harm.</i> These actions are always visible but most people remain silent about them.</li><li><i>Some children are alone with no one to care for them and nowhere to turn to. </i>Such children also have a right to protection.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Protecting children requires that the government invests in various areas. These areas include charities, schools, care homes, and hospitals. To ensure children's safety, employees who work in such institutions need adequate training which will ensure that they competently carry out their duties.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c3183895ba1e26c0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Coronavirus: Engaging activities you can do to avoid boredom following the stay at home order</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Also, institutions that deal with vulnerable groups have a duty of ensuring that they do not employ the wrong people. They are supposed to carry out a criminal background check of all their employees and volunteers. Defenceless people should always be left in the hands of caring and responsible staff.</p><p class=align-left>Now that you know what is safeguarding, you should always be vigilant. Remember that safety begins with you. You should be quick to notice and report all suspected cases of child abuse.</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnR8k2locGWnna61edKanZ6fpZa%2FpbXNoGSdnZaeu6rAyKilZqiinruktc%2BlnKxloKe8pLHDrqmeq16dwa64</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./393103-young-woman-inspires-social-media-plumbing-job-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Young woman inspires social media with her plumbing job</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pdp-national-convention.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Read All The Latest News About PDP National Convention On Naija News</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
