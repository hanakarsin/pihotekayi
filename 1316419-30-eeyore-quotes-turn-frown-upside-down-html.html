Milne created Eeyore in the 1926 book titled <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Winnie-the-Pooh</a></i>. He is a donkey whose tail is attached to the rest of his body by a nail. The most notable thing about him is that he often makes bitter and self-deprecating comments. He is the complete opposite of Winnie the Pooh, who is an affectionate but clumsy bear. Winnie also has a very little brain.</p><h2>Best Eeyore quotes</h2><p class=align-left>Where did the name Eyeore come from?
