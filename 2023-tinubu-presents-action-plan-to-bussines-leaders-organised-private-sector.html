You may have heard that I was once the governor of this dynamic economic force.</p><p>“However, may I remind you that when I first entered the office, Lagos was a different story. My team and I developed a blueprint, a master plan, for Lagos. I can say that plan has been largely successful.</p><p>“We turned this state into a safer, more prosperous place where people can go about any legitimate vocation or venture regardless of their ethnicity, religion, region, or prior social status. We did more than open Lagos for business. We opened the door for all of Nigeria to join and experience the decent things progressive democratic governance can bring.</p><p>“We were not perfect but we did a lot. In doing so, we worked hand in hand with the business community as partners sharing the same goals of prosperity and renewed hope. Well, as you might have heard at some point recently, I now stand before you, seeking a bigger yet similar job.”</p><p>Tinubu said the nation needs to move from dependence on exporting its raw materials to one that refines its raw materials for upward export itself.</p><p>According to Tinubu, his administration’s plan is to build on the achievements of President Muhammadu Buhari-led government and continue from where it stopped.</p><p>Tinubu promised to continue the fight against insecurity by redefining counterinsurgency doctrine and practice and recruiting more personnel into the police and other security agencies.</p><p>He said: “I have saved the single most important point for last. May I conclude with my thoughts on security? We shall continue the fight against insecurity by redefining our counterinsurgency doctrine and practice.</p><p>“Our response to terror, kidnapping, and violent criminality will be defined by the following elements. We shall enlist more people in the armed forces, security services and police. Our forces will be given better tactical communications, and mobility as well as improved aerial and ground surveillance capacity.</p><p>“Through these and other measures, we shall better identify, monitor, track, and defeat these evil groups where they are. They shall have no respite until they surrender or are utterly defeated”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49rZmtoYmh6tbXNrpmuZaCnsrSxza2qZpmTqbawuoypo5qmXam8bq7UrKqippWoeq2xwJ2cq6tdpL%2Borc2iqp6cXaW%2FqsLArZxmq5WYwbC%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./405470-tanzania-sentences-20-kenyans-1-year-imprisonment-entering-country-illegally-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tanzania sentences over 20 Kenyans to 1-year imprisonment for entering country illegally</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./creed-from-the-office-now.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Real-Life Creed Bratton Is Almost as Mysterious as His 'The Office' Character</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
