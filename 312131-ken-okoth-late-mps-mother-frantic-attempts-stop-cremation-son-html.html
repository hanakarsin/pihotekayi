She is pleading for help so that she can bury her son..." one of the Luo legislators shared with colleagues in a WhatsApp group.<p class=align-left>Unfortunately for the bereaved mother, there was little the Luo politicians could do to help, especially considering the issue at hand was a family matter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/2c056c138f83489d.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Ken Okoth's alleged lover says MP fulfilled parental responsibilities</strong></p><p class=align-left>Having objected to the cremation which was shrouded in confusion and secrecy, Ajwang' and other family members were not present during the ceremony held at around 3am on Saturday at Keriokor crematorium in Nairobi.</p><p class=align-left>According to Okoth's nephew Elvis Oluoch, the mother was not even aware her son was going to be burnt to ashes at Keriokor that Saturday morning and only came to learn about it after it was already done.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Viewing of Ken Okoth's body, funeral service set for Thursday in Kibra</strong></p><p class=align-left>Although the widow, Monica, maintained that was how her husband wanted her body to be disposed, a defiant mother-in-law and other family members couldn't hear any of it and continued to make plans for Okoth's burial back at his maternal home in Homa Bay county.</p>"We only heard Ken left a Will directing he be cremated upon death. None of our family members has set eyes on that said Will. All through, we have been making arrangements to have Ken transported to Homa Bay and be buried on his mother’s land.
