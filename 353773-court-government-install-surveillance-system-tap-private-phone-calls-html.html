Justice John Mativo of the High Court ruled the government's action amounted to intrusion of privacy and that there was no consultation</strong></p><p class=align-left><strong>- The Court of Appeal set aside the High Court orders allowing government to continue with consultations with the service providers</strong></p><p class=align-left>The government may soon start monitoring your private phone conversations after Court of Appeal set aside High Court orders barring implementation of a mass surveillance system.</p><p class=align-left>The Communications Authority of Kenya (CAK) was to install the controversial Data Management System (DMS) meant to monitor and tap into phone networks.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Mike Tyson's marijuana company want to buy

Karen home</p><p class=align-left>Justices William Ouko, Martha Koome and Daniel Musinga faulted High Court judge John Mativo for failure to prove with evidence that the system was meant to spy on private information.</p><p class=align-left>Mativo had thrown out the case on grounds that the government could be targeting consumers' private information, but the authority insisted DMS was only meant to detect fake mobile devices.</p><p class=align-left>Mativo issued orders barring implementation of the system before the authority moved to the Court of Appeal.</p><p class=align-left>The three judges ruled it was necessary to get rid of fake mobile devices but at the same time there was need to implement the system in consultation with service providers namely Safaricom, Airtel and Telkom Kenya.</p>"The right to privacy is important but the issues of abuse by unscrupulous mobile operators also need to be tackled so as to strike balance between securing the right to privacy and dealing with the problem without infringing on the right to privacy," read the court ruling that was read by Justice Koome. <img

ALSO:</strong> Coronavirus update: 12 more Kenyans test positive, national count climbs to 355</p><p class=align-left>In his ruling, Mativo had indicated the authority was going beyond its mandate as there was a counterfeit agency in place and that the service providers could still detect and blacklist fake devices.</p><p class=align-left>The matter was started in January 2017 when former CA director general Francis Wangusi wrote to the telecom operators to allow them install the DMS, but the companies rejected the request on grounds that its was a spyware to infringe on privacy of customers.</p><p class=align-left>Human rights activist, Okiya Omtatah, and other interested groups moved to court arguing it was inappropriate for the government to go for the fake devices when they are at the hands of citizens and instead they should be tapped at the point of entry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

yakichacha</p><p class=align-left>During the Appellate Court hearing, Safaricom said it was inappropriate to allow installation of the system arbitrarily without consultation because it amounted to intrusion of privacy as the telecom operators are not supposed to disclose data to third parties.</p><p class=align-left>Telkom Kenya on its side told the court it was comfortable with either outcome of the case. Airtel which was also mentioned as a party in the matter did not file its reply.</p><p class=align-left>The judges were informed consultations with the telecommunications were still underway and the set substituted the High Court orders requiring the appellant to continue with the consultations.</p>"In exercise of its mandate of developing a DMS system, the appellant shall continue with the consultations that were ongoing with the stakeholders and MNOs prior to the filing of the petition so as to complete the technical and consumer guidelines on the DMS," said the three-bench judge.<p class=align-left>The judges also directed the guidelines or regulations for implementing the system be subjected to public participation.</p><p class=align-left>Already, the tender to install the system had been awarded to Broadcast Communications Network Ltd to install and maintain it at the cost of KSh 100 million.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
