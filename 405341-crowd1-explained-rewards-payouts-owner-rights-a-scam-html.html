Crowd1 is a perfect example. As more people continued to invest in the scheme, there was a need to unravel the concept. Most stakeholders and potential recruits continue to question Crowd1's way of making money, and this article debunks everything.</p><h2>What is Crowd1?</h2><p class=align-left>Crowd1 presents itself as a high-tech crowd marketing <a href=#>business</a>. The system works by recruiting new people from society to its business practice. The deal is to keep recruiting more members with endless money-making promises or ownership rights.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/bb9901c150f614c9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to The Timepiece Gentleman?

The concept of introducing as many people to the scheme is what makes investors earn more. Besides your investment, any additional member in your name guarantees some level of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rewards</a>.</p><p class=align-left>You are allowed to buy a profit share package and receive owner rights/profit shares. Below are the different Crowd1 <a id=https://hoekomikaangeld.com/crowd1-pioneer-owner-rights-value/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">packages</a>:</p><h3>White €99</h3><p class=align-left>The white pack is more often than not considered a starter pack. Its rewards are not as great as the rest but newbies appreciate its gains which include:</p><ul><li>One-off profit share worth €100</li><li>Weekly streamline bonus up to €10</li><li>Residual bonus 5% of the company monthly profit</li></ul><h3>Black €299</h3><p class=align-left>In this package, members are not shy to risk their investments.

In most cases, they have tasted the rewards and strongly believe in the system. Below are the lucrative deals that come with the Gold pack:</p><ul><li>One-off profit share worth €1000</li><li>Weekly streamline bonus up to €250</li><li>Residual income 10% of company monthly profit</li></ul><h3>Titanium €2499</h3><p class=align-left>Those in this tier are mostly the founders and other devoted members who can attribute their financial success to Crowd1 proceeds. The sponsors of the titanium pack enjoy:</p><ul><li>One-off profit share worth €3500</li><li>Weekly streamline bonus up to €1000</li><li>Residual income 10% of company monthly profit</li></ul><h3>How are Crowd1 rewards calculated?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/bb9901c150f614c9.jpeg><p class=align-left>After selecting your preferred pack, your benefactor will facilitate payment for the chosen package. At this level, newbies are advised to trust their sponsors throughout the process. A common question that arises at this point is, "what are owner rights Crowd 1?"</p><p class=align-left>As a member, you will get additional free proprietor rights (Benefit Offers) each week on Fridays. Ideally, you should ensure you claim the benefits through the system. Similarly, your <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">proprietor rights</a> amass depending on the level of the package.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/25c358f4eb7bbaeb.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Storage Wars cast net worth: Who is the richest member?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In essence, the higher the package, the more the returns. Payment is done either through the company's Gift Codes or Bitcoins.</p><h3>How to earn Crowd1 Commissions</h3><p class=align-left>Crowd1 pays its <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">commissions</a> through a paired remuneration structure. Positions in the paired groups are filled through the immediate and asymmetrical enlistment of members.</p><p class=align-left>There is, however, no restriction to how profound a paired group can develop. Project profit capacity relies on the team’s efforts which are also virtually pegged on Crowd1's package levels.</p><h3>How does Crowd1 make money?</h3><p class=align-left>One of the enticing motives for joining the scheme is the promise to become an instant mogul. The organization refers to itself as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">multi-level marketing</a> (MLM) plan, where you market, sell and acquire.</p><p class=align-left>These guarantees have effectively persuaded thousands of individuals across Africa to purchase enrollment into Crowd1.</p><p class=align-left>As with every Ponzi scheme, individuals bring in cash by procuring a commission for an extra part brought into the platform. This implies that the more individuals you bring to the program, the more money you stand to gain.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/17f48fd8a8ad1cb3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 apps like Earnin: cash advance apps alternatives</span></p></a><h3>How to delete a Crowd1 account</h3><p class=align-left>If you are no longer interested in Crowd1, here are four steps to follow to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">delete</a> your account:</p><li>Open your email account that is enrolled with the application or site</li><li>Draft an email and enter the email address infor@Crowd1.com</li><li>Your subject matter should be: “Request to Delete my Crowd1 Account”</li><li>The body of your email should encompass a legitimate reason as to why you wish to erase your record from their data set</li><h2>Is Crowd1 a pyramid scheme?</h2><p class=align-left>Yes, it is.
