Despite being in Cameron's shadow, she has an exciting life. A considerable chunk of Vanessa Arevalo biography does not involve her celebrity husband.</p><h2>Quick facts about Vanessa Arevalo</h2><p class=align-left>During the years that Vanessa has been a fashion model, a lot has happened in her career and personal life. What do you know so far?</p><h3>1. Vanessa Arevalo is from Puerto Rico</h3><p class=align-left>The former fashion model was born in the early 1980s in Puerto Rico. Even though she does not share details of her schooling, she attended local schools in her country before going to the United States to launch her modelling career. Vanessa Arevalo parents were middle-class citizens.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c8edea257553f549.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Montana Helena Klein Yao: What you should know about Malik Beasley's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Her father, for example, worked in the construction business in Puerto Rico. Vanessa's mother worked in the service industry as a supermarket cashier. Unfortunately, she has withheld their names because she is a believer in privacy.</p><p class=align-left>What nationality is Vanessa Arevalo? The business person is Puerto Rican. She is proud of her origin and the culture of her home country. However, she now lives in North America with her husband and children. Vanessa's business is also in the USA instead of her home country.</p><p class=align-left>Since she is from the Caribbean island, she is a multi-racial person. However, Vanessa Arevalo ethnicity is never a concern to her or her loyal fans.</p><h3>2. She is a former fashion model</h3><p class=align-left>Before meeting the TV star, she was a model. She travelled to different parts of the <a href=#>world</a>, and more importantly, the Puerto Rican graced various magazine covers. She also worked with several North America’s brands.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/e8f6feb3040bc3c2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jose Stemkens: the untold story of Titus Welliver's ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When she married Cameron in the early 2000s, Vanessa’s career came to a sudden halt. However, her foundation in modelling influenced her new life in two ways. First, she saw a void in the premium clothes market for kids. Second, she used her connections from modelling to source funds for her new company KEA + JOBY.</p><p class=align-left>Vanessa’s earlier career has also redefined her career as a co-founder of a fashion brand. Besides driving sales to her company in the past year, Cameron’s wife uses the media curiosity (about her life) for marketing. Interviews from known media outlets <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">such as CBB</a> helps her company get good media coverage.</p><p class=align-left>The former model also has interests in the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">La Models</a>, a modelling company in Los Angeles. Although she has never disclosed the percentage of her ownership in the modelling agency, Vanessa often promotes it on her social media pages. The agency’s social media link is also on her Instagram <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">account’s bio</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9f4410d7ebb96694.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Vanessa Kingori: The story of Kenyan-born British Vogue Publishing Director</span></p></a><h3>3. Vanessa met Cameron Mathison in 1998</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c8edea257553f549.jpeg><p class=align-left>The first encounter between the two was on a 1998 ski trip. Although two had met before in a health club meeting, the trip gave them a chance to talk for the first time. Since then, they became best friends and later lovers.</p><p class=align-left>Cameron proposed to his girlfriend in January 2002. The TV star chose the Summit of Vail Mountain (Colorado) to remind his then-girlfriend about their shared interests, especially skiing. He also chose the location because Colorado means a lot to them as a couple.</p><h3>4. She has been married for close to two decades</h3><p class=align-left>The two officiated their union on July 27, 2002. Even though the two are from large families, they opted for a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">private and small wedding</a> ceremony. However, details about their wedding, such as Vanessa wearing a gorgeous backless dress, were highlighted in fashion media outlets.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/206a76df1ee6fd43.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Marie Pierre Bouchard: quick facts about the Just For Laughs star</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Since then, Vanessa and Cameron have been some of the few celebrity couples globally admired. Even though they still confess that they have their share of challenges as married people, their honesty and ever-growing love <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">make the two admirable</a>.</p><h3>5. She is a mother of two</h3><p class=align-left>Vanessa Arevalo and Cameron Mathison have two children. Lucas and Leila were born in 2003 and 2006, respectively. As a mother of two, Vanessa has adjusted her life differently. For example, she gave up her modelling career to be a stay-home mother.</p><p class=align-left>In a 2008 interview with Parents, Cameron described Vanessa as a “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hand-on mother</a>” to Leila and Lucas. When the TV star is working or travelling, Vanessa is with the children. Their parenting approach has worked for them.</p><p class=align-left>Like most celebrities, the two are fond of their parenting memories. Every Christmas, Cameron shares his family’s activities, especially baking. One of their Christmas experiences appeared on a <i>Home & <a href=#>Family</a></i> episode. The December episode was also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Leila’s debut on TV</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/5096cf2739922ea2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Anna Beth Goodman: What you need to know about John Goodman's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Venessa also used her experience as a parent to venture into business. Her firstborn son's experience shopping for clothes is why she became interested in children's fashion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/e8f6feb3040bc3c2.jpeg><h3>6. She has been there for her husband through thick and thin</h3><p class=align-left>A quick scan through <a id=https://www.instagram.com/cameronmathison/ href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">Cameron’s Instagram page</a> shows how inseparable he is from Vanessa. Since the two have interests in different markets, they have learned how to make sacrifices. For example, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Vanessa told the People</a> that she used to fly every week to Los Angeles to see Cameron when he had a tight shooting schedule.</p><p class=align-left>Making the sacrifice saved her relationship with Cameron, mainly because Dancing with the Stars is a draining show for the cast members. They two are also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">avid travellers</a>. While Vanessa travels more than her husband, she often tags her husband along, especially when he is not working.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f667f7dc5a0265c9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lia Marie Johnson: net worth, manager, songs, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Exploring exotic destinations such as Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and France is therapeutic to the couple. However, their love test was when Cameron was<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> diagnosed with cancer</a>. Vanessa was “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">his rock</a>” as he came to terms with his cancer diagnosis, where doctors detected renal cell carcinoma in his kidneys. She has also helped him ensure the family is safe during his absence.</p><p class=align-left>In the last two decades, Vanessa Arevalo has moved careers, married and become a mother. However, becoming a wife to one of the most popular TV personalities in North America, Cameron Mathison, has redefined her life.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> created an interesting piece highlighting fascinating facts about the established BBC Journalist <a href=#>Kate Silverton</a>. The journalist has been reporting for the broadcaster from dangerous areas like Afghanistan and Iraq.</p><p class=align-left>Aside from her impressive journalism skills, she is a great swimmer and a supporter of conservations charities. There's much to the characters that people view on screen, and Kate Silverton is a great testament to this.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/746358fa8de6a4c4.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Meet Helena Seger: The life story and facts about Zlatan Ibrahimovic's wife</span></p></a><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCAj3Fta25dq66vsdKsmGaZoprDorjOZqiuoZOgeqetwq2qZpuRorKzu81mpJqsmJ7AsLrSZq6inpVjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./distracted-with-cg5.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Distracted With...
