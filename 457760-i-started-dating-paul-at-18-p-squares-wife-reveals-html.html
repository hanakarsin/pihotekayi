Those who know her will attest to the fact that she is very reserved and media shy.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As a matter of fact, what you are about to read is her first media interview. Anita, who already has a son, Andre for the music star, shares her story with <strong>Legit.ng</strong> in this exclusive and precise interview.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>Harrysong Hints On His Upcoming ‘Talent And Grace’ Album</p><p><strong>Anita, how did you feel when Paul proposed to you?</strong></p><p>Paul took me to a jewellery store and got me to pick out any nice diamond ring from a selection of 10, I did, and then right there he dropped on one knee and popped the question. It was sudden and such a spontaneous romantic gesture. I was floored and bursted into tears.</p><p><strong>You must be in Cloud Nine by then?</strong></p><p>Of course.</p><p><strong>So how has the journey been?</strong></p><p>My marriage has been very interesting. Paul and I have known each other since I was 16 years old and we started dating when I was 18. I am married to my best friend. I know him more than he knows himself and the same goes for him. It is such a fun marriage and our son is a major blessing to us. We are indeed blessed.</p><p><strong>What was the centre of attraction? Why did you say ‘yes’ when he asked you out?</strong></p><p>His humility, kindness and realness were spectacular. During our first encounter in the university, we literally fought over ice cream. He is super funny and doesn’t have an air around him. He is an amazingly humble, reserved and &nbsp;very compassionate man. He can take the shirt off his back and hand it to a stranger in need.</p><p><strong>But did you ever envisage that he would be the P-Square that is celebrated all over the world today?</strong></p><p>I wasn’t thinking of marriage when my husband and I started dating, I was pretty young. I fell head over heels in love with him and just went with the flow.</p><p>I knew he was going to be a superstar because of the passion he possesses for music. Paul breathes music and has always expressed his love for it. I am grateful to God for where he is now. I however, didn’t know they were going to be this huge! I remember seeing their first show in Congo (I think) and people crying… I was like “were these fans really crying for you guys”… It’s amazing. Thanks to God and the super fans.</p><p><strong>How did you adjust to life as a married woman?</strong></p><p>There wasn’t much of an adjustment really. We have always been inseparable, and so this just solidified our relationship.</p><p><strong>What would you like to change about each other?</strong></p><p>I don’t think there is anything I’ll like to change in my husband. He is a wonderful father and husband. Whatever flaw he has (if any, as I can’t think of one), makes him Paul Okoye. I wouldn’t change my husband for the world.</p><p><strong>How do you manage the fame and attention that comes with your current status?</strong></p><p>For a very long time, I had tried to be completely sheltered from the media. Our engagement and wedding finally put a face to the name “Anita”. When people say, “are you P-square’s wife?” I laugh and reply, “I’m Paul’s wife”.</p><p>At work, I’m a regular employee until my husband decides to surprise me for lunch and my colleagues go crazy with pictures (laughs).</p><p>I have managed being his wife pretty well. I have my little group of friends and still do everything I did before the P-square ‘takeover’.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;<a class=row-title href=# title="Edit “Yahooze Crooner, Olu Maintain Is Reportedly Broke!

Read What His Landlord Did To Him</a></p><p><strong>What common hobbies do you share?</strong></p><p>We are quite the active couple; we love the outdoors, so we share our love for riding bicycles, beach volleyball, running around with our son, niece and nephew…just goofing around. We also love watching CNN, comedy central and crime channels together.</p><p><strong>What causes quarrels between the two of you?</strong></p><p>We have very different views when it comes to fashion, style and interior design.</p><p><strong>How do you make up when there is a quarrel?</strong></p><p>We usually laugh things off, but the lawyer in me has to drive my point across at the end.</p><p><strong>What pet names do you call each other?</strong></p><p>For our ears only (laughs).</p><p><strong>Paul Okoye</strong> and<strong> Anita Okoye</strong>, who had their&nbsp;traditional wedding ceremony in 2014&nbsp;have legalized their union also&nbsp;at the Ikoyi Registry earlier this year.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgXaDlm9nZqFdqMGivtOem2ackam2r7OMqZiupF2WwW59l2anZquhqq6zsdJmrqKelWK%2FpsLEmqOsZpipuq0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aurelia-souza-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Aurelia de Souza - Trivia, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-spray-painted-monty-was-framed.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Spray-Painted the School in '13 Reasons Why'?
