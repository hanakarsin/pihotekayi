persons is believed to be trapped in the rubble of an uncompleted four-storey building that collapsed on Monday in Onitsha, Anambra.</strong></p><p>The News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, reports that the building, which collapsed at about 1:00pm., is part of a structure being erected for a primary school at St. Christopher’s Anglican Church, Odo-akpu, Onitsha.</p><p>According to an eyewitness, the collapsed building may have trapped at least five workers plastering its interior.</p><p>“The ill-fated building was meant to serve as classroom blocks for pupils of St. Christopher’s Primary school,” he said, adding that it was near completion.</p><p>One of the teachers at St Christopher’s Primary school, who did not want to be named, told reporters that the building collapsed few minutes after the bell signalled the end of break time.</p><p><strong>* File photo of a collapsed building</strong></p><p>“This building has been where our children play during break time, but as God will have it, shortly after we rang the bell to order them back to their classes the building collapsed,” she said.</p><p>Emeka Okafor, Executive Assistant to Governor on Political Liaison Office for Onitsha South Constituency, described the incident as unfortunate.</p><p>“We have notified construction companies in Onitsha and it would not be long before they arrive with their earth-moving vehicle,” he assured.</p><p>Mrs Ann Chukwuneke, Chairperson, Onitsha South local government Council, said that efforts were ongoing to rescue the trapped workers.</p><p>“I am here now, and I am not leaving until it is clear to me that nobody is trapped in there.”</p><p>Senior officials of the Police and Federal Road Safety Commission, FRSC, who were on ground at the scene, refused to talk with journalists, saying only the church authorities and eyewitnesses could give account of the incident.</p><p>As at the time of compiling this report, it was gathered that one of the trapped workers, although feared dead, was excavated from the rubble of the collapsed building.&nbsp;</p><p>It could be recalled that <a href=#>two teenagers were killed in Akure, Ondo State capital last month after a building under construction collapsed around 7am.</a></p><p>The tragic incident was reported to have happened as construction workers were about to start the day’s job at a private secondary school under construction at Igoba community in Akure North Local Government Area.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid
