When he newly entered the industry he barely spoke, posing&nbsp;with his trademark walking stick, his then&nbsp;partner, D’Banj, acting as&nbsp;his mouth piece. He whispered&nbsp;in D’Banj’s ears and the Kokomaster passed on the message to the&nbsp;world.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>However, subsequent events in his career have shown that the leader of the Supreme Mavin Dynasty may not be as reserved as he may have wanted the public to believe. As&nbsp;calm as he may appear in public, since his start with Mo'Hits, he has been consistently involved in one major beef or the other with his colleagues in the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Legit.ng contributor, Olayinka Obey takes us through five of the major public drama, Don Jazzy has been involved including the latest - and since resolved - Headies war-of-words with Olamide.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;#Headies 2015: Bastard Forming Humble – Olamide Blasts Don Jazzy</p><p><strong>1. Don Jazzy vs. Kay Switch</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt7224t2a5oq4.jpeg><p>You remember Kay Switch? D’Banj’s younger brother and a member of the defunct Mo’Hits crew? It may come as a&nbsp;surprise to many that&nbsp;Kay Switch didn't record even one&nbsp;single under the label for the about eight years he swas signed to it.&nbsp;No wonder he&nbsp;included several shades to Don Jazzy in the lyrics of his songs since leaving Mo'hits.&nbsp;Kay Switch claimed his brother's former partner did not believe in his musical talents and as such denied him several chances to prove his worth. Even though he doesn’t call any names, an astute listener&nbsp;of&nbsp;Kay Switch's songs would know who he is singing about.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Don Jazzy vs.&nbsp;D’Banj</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt6n8hgm2lurs.jpeg><p>This was the one that broke our hearts to pieces. Who does not&nbsp;know the story of D’Banj and Don Jazzy? They had a formidable and enviable partnership with their then label, churning out hits after hits. But the Mo’Hits ship capsized in 2012 and the&nbsp;split to&nbsp;form their own record labels, with only Kay Switch following his brother to DB Records and the rest staying with Don Jazzy and his&nbsp;Mavin Records.</p><p>The D’Banj/Don Jazzy beef was reportedly based on&nbsp;the former's desire to widen his musical coasts to the US while the latter preferred to stay in his own lane, and remain in Nigeria where they were already big.&nbsp;They have tried several&nbsp;times&nbsp;to bury the hatchet and move on, having been seen together at shows dedicating awards to each other and most recently performing together at Timaya’s I Concur concert. Even&nbsp;2Face Idibia pleaded for one more song for the fans&nbsp;at his Fortyfied concert back in September 2015.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Don Jazzy vs.&nbsp;JJC</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt64fgdfmi03o.jpeg><p>&nbsp;JJC was&nbsp;the frontman of a UK-based Nigerian music group called&nbsp;JJC and 419 Squad with which D’Banj and Don Jazzy were associated, although not regular members of the band. The duo, however, moved to Nigeria to establish the defunct Mo’Hits and build a large music empire to the disappointment of JJC. On his return to the country, JJC went on several media blasting both Don Jazzy and D’Banj for their "betrayal". However, these days, it appears tempers have cooled as the African Skank singer, back in 2014, was seen in&nbsp;Don Jazzy’s Mavin Records studio making beats.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>Don Jazzy, Olamide Apologise To Fans, Read What They Said</p><p><strong>4.

Prior to release of that song, Wande Coal had shown an inclination to stand alone, launching his&nbsp;Black Diamond label.&nbsp;Things went&nbsp;sour when Don Jazzy publicly accused Wande Coal of intellectual theft on social media for the Babyface, which pushed the latter to finally announce his exit from Mavin Records.&nbsp;It turned out to be a huge show of shame from erstwhile partners as many thought there issues&nbsp;should have been sorted out privately. The controversy affected the acceptance of the song.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>5. Don Jazzy vs.&nbsp;Olamide</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt71h28n6d54t.jpeg><p>The latest and biggest of the many Don Jazzy&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;other artistes beefs is the 2016 agenda setting music industry beef on January 1, at The Headies. &nbsp;Olamide, who felt the award organizers cheated his protégé Lil Kesh in 2015 out of the Rookie of the Year was furious when the Efejoku singer lost again to Mavin's Reekado Banks. He expressed his rage at the awards organizers when another of his protégé Adekunle Gold stepped up to receive his award for Sade&nbsp;in&nbsp;the Best Alternative Song category.&nbsp;Don Jazzy, while receiving the Special Recognition award, chose to respond to Olamide's rant, which he assumed was directed at him and his Mavin crew. Olamide then went on to "wash" the Don on Twitter, calling his humility a show. The two have since reconciled but would that be the end of the beef?</p><p>We watch&nbsp;with bated breath.&nbsp;</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3mBkHBqZqOZo7RursSenaxlZWLBqrnErGSdp55it6LG2bJkn5mTmrFuu8WfZJqqpJ7Atb%2BNoaumpA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./skincare-smoothie-trend-tiktok.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>People Are Out Here Making Skincare Smoothies and Making a Mess</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./2023-gov-ayade-speaks-on-buhari-picking-his-successor.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gov Ayade Speaks On Buhari Picking His Successor</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
