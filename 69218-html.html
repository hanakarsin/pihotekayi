As far I know, if something happens to you while you are conducting an unlawful act it is a criminal offence.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>“But it is really disappointing&nbsp; that public servants, and that is what soldiers are, paid with tax payer’s money, will act in a manner that is being&nbsp; suggested.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>“I am waiting for the official report to let me know who played what role and what happened. And whether the Brigade Commander has been able to identify the people who committed the offence. If it turns out to be true, it will be a very irresponsible conduct, to put it very mildly.</i></p><p><a href=#><strong>RELATED: Soldiers Didn't Burn BRT Buses In Lagos - Nigerian Army</strong></a></p><p><i>“In 2006&nbsp; soldiers stormed&nbsp;&nbsp; the Area C Police Station. We have just managed to reconstruct it. If buses that citizens are complaining are&nbsp; not enough are set ablaze, I do not know how setting ablaze buses recompense any injury that one may have suffered.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>"I do not know how damaging public property is the restitution for&nbsp; any injury that may have come. For now, the only thing that I can say to you is that when I get the full fact, I will address the residents, to let them know what happened and what the state action will be.</i></p><p><i>“I have been in touch with the Brigade commander, who assured&nbsp; me&nbsp; that he was managing the situation. Nothing I have here is verified, I am waiting for a&nbsp; formal report before we can ventilate a position”.</i></p><p>It was reported yesterday (Friday) that the <a href=#><u><strong>soldiers burnt over 8 BRT&nbsp;Buses</strong></u></a>, beat up drivers and even innocent Lagosians after one of their colleagues was allegedly killed by BRT who were going about their normal day-to-day activities at Palmgrove, Ikorodu road of the state.</p><p><a href=#>RELATED: BRT Bus Did Not Kill&nbsp;Any&nbsp;Soldier</a></p><p>The Public Relations Officer of the Nigerian Army, Gen. Olajide Olaleye, however, denied the involvement of the soldiers in the attack saying:</p><p><i>"It’s not true that soldier destroyed buses or set any bus on fire. What happened was that a BRT bus knocked down a soldier and killed him"</i>.</p><p>Meanwhile a LAGBUS official, Abiodun Apata said that <a href=#><u><strong>BRT wasn't responsible for the death of the soldier</strong></u></a> as they reportedly found that "<i>a corpse had been deposited in our bus and a motorcycle parked behind it".</i><i></i></p><p><a href=#><strong>RELATED: Lagos APC Youth Leader Condemns Attack On BRT Buses By Nigerian Army In Lagos</strong></a></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3p%2BkHFloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./breaking-igp-egbetokun-orders-nationwide-posting-of-acps-to-head-intelligence-units.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>IGP Egbetokun Orders Nationwide Posting Of ACPs To Head Intelligence Units</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./drugrixh-peso-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Drugrixh Peso - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
