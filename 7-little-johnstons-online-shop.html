But three siblings of the five kids on <a href=#><u>7 Little Johnstons</u></a> have online shops to help them earn their own living without even leaving their home. Who wouldn't kill for an after-school job like that?</p><p>Alex and Emma Johnston, who were adopted by parents Trent and Amber Johnston years ago, have an ongoing storyline about learning to drive. But the bigger thing going on in their lives are the online stores they both run as teenagers. Their older sister Anna also started her own online store. They might not be raking in millions of dollars from their little businesses, but you have to admire their shared entrepreneurial spirit.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what are the '7 Little Johnstons' online shops?</h2><p>Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Anna lost her job at a daycare center. So, instead of leaning on proceeds from the show, she turned to the internet to start a business safely. She sells bracelets on her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Etsy</u></a> shop and she has an Instagram dedicated to her business called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fizz4Passion</u></a>. She started the business in 2019 and she already has tons of five star reviews and more than 1,500 sales on Etsy alone.</p><p>Little sister Emma started her own jewelry shop online called EmmasRingsnThings. She, too, has an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Instagram</u></a> account and an official <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Etsy</u></a> shop up and running to sell earrings, bows, and other little odds and ends. It's not as high profile as Anna's just yet, but she seems really into trying to get it off the ground and running. And, so far, Emma has made hundreds of sales.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Alex Johnston (@jalexjohnston)</a></p></figure><p>Alex has his own origami shop on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Etsy</u></a>. Although he doesn't appear to have any products listed at this time, he has plenty of reviews from satisfied customers. In the past, he has made animals, bookmarks, and even phone stands out of origami projects. As of right now, he has almost 400 sales. It's a pretty sweet alternative to the kinds of jobs most teenagers have to get.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Trent and Amber Johnston still have jobs despite being on TV.</h2><p>Having a strong work ethic is nothing new to the Jonhstons, though. Parents Trent and Amber Johnston have continued to work outside of the show following their success on 7 Little Johnstons. While the show likely pays them well for sharing their lives with the world, Trent is still a head of landscaping at a local college and Amber works in real estate.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by ELIZABETH JOHNSTON (@lizzzjohnston)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Do the other Johnston kids work?</h2><p>According to LinkedIn, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Jonah Johnston</u></a> worked as a soccer referee before he became a representative for the Georgia Forestry Commission. Elizabeth is in school to become a pediatric nurse practitioner and she runs a side business as well. On <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Instagram</u></a>, Elizabeth shares various watercolor paintings that people can buy through multiple payment apps.</p><p>The Johnston family has a hit reality TV show and literally all of them are also working in some way outside of it. And, while there doesn't seem to be an end in sight for the series, clearly Trent and Amber have taught their kids something valuable about working hard to set themselves up for when the show is over.</p><p>Watch 7 Little Johnstons on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfbHqttdOto55lmqS1r7%2FTqKWsZZ%2Bjuaq6xGaqoaeg</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jack-howard-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jack Howard - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./james-saito-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>James Saito - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
