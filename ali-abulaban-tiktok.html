Here's everything we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Abulaban is facing double-murder charges due to the killings of his estranged wife and her male friend.</h2><p>Per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a>, the TikTok star stands accused of committing the heinous murders of his wife, Ana Abulaban, 28, and her friend, Rayburn Cadenas Barron, 29. Abulaban has been formally charged with two counts of murder. He is also charged with special-circumstance allegations of multiple killings, which allows prosecutors to seek the death penalty if he’s convicted. On Oct. 25, 2021, Abulaban pleaded not guilty during his arraignment.</p><p>Deputy District Attorney Taren Brast shared in court that Ana had asked Abulaban to move out of their San Diego apartment on Oct. 18, 2021, following several incidents of domestic violence, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">San Diego Union-Tribune</a>. Abulaban checked into a hotel and later returned to the residence while his wife was gone.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>East Village Double Murder. Prosecutor says Ali Nasser Abulaban, 29, installed an app on his daughter’s iPad to stalk and monitor his wife. He’s charged with shooting and killing his wife and her friend.

Prosecuters say he heard his wife and a man talking and laughing while listening to the app. And that’s when things went completely left.</p><p>Security cameras in the apartment complex captured Abulaban racing out of the elevator to the residence. Brast shared that Abulaban allegedly shot Barron three times before shooting Ana in the head.</p><p>Strangely, Abulaban reportedly called his mother and confessed to the crime. And after picking up his daughter from school, he called the police and was immediately taken into custody with his child in tow.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Facebook</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Abulaban is a gifted content creator who went viral for his 'Scarface' impersonations.</h2><p>Abulaban has earned over 950,000 followers on TikTok. He's stood out on the platform for his Tony Montana impersonations, inspired by the 1983 film Scarface.</p><p>His wife was also featured in some of his videos on the short-form video app. In an Aug. 19, 2021 post, the former couple recorded a video together that consisted of Ana doing impressions of various celebrities.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@jinnkid href=#>@jinnkid</a><p>Asking my wife to try impressions! <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=4u href=#>#4u</a> @anamacewindu <a title=6ix9ine href=#>#6ix9ine</a> <a title=jinnkid href=#>#jinnkid</a> <a title=scarface href=#>#scarface</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - JinnKid" href=#>♬ original sound - JinnKid</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok</a></figure><p>Abulaban now finds himself in a world of trouble. Due to the heinous nature of the crimes he stands accused of, Judge Kimberlee Lagotta ordered him to be jailed without bail. A protective order has also been put in place that requires Abulaban to stay away from his daughter.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>What makes the situation even more saddening is the fact that Ana reportedly planned to file a restraining order against her husband due to his alleged abuse. However, she was unable to do so.</p><p>At this time, we would like to give our deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Ana Abulaban and Rayburn Cadenas Barron. Hopefully, justice can be served.</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrmqecCbrKWZkpa7bsDIpKuoow%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hoarders.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Hoarders' Latest News and Updates</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sofia-richie-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sofia Richie - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
