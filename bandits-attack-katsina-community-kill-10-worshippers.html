Upon sighting the worshippers, they reportedly opened fire on them.</p><p>It was revealed that the bandits rid the residents of their money, phones, clothes, foodstuff, and other personal items. They also rustled several domestic animals after they burned down houses and food stores.</p><p>In their testimony, residents lamented that the telecommunication shutdown in the council prevented them from reaching out for help from security agencies as the bandits operated for several hours before leaving.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Bandits-in-Katsina-3.jpg alt="Bandits Kill Muslim Worshippers in Katsina" width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Bandits-in-Katsina-2.jpg alt="Bandits Kill Muslim Worshippers in Katsina" width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Daily Trust reports that a resident had told them that the attackers came despite the ongoing military and police offensive.</p><p>“We have seen the impact of the recent military onslaught against these criminals because their attacks are not as frequent as it used to be but it is still very difficult for farmers to harvest their farm produce,” Daily Trust quoted the source as saying.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> understands that at least 11 people survived the attack with severe injuries. The source also revealed that many residents had escaped been lynched in the attack by fleeing to the headquarters of Batsari Local Government for safety.</p><p>Though residents had claimed that 16 people were killed in the attack, the spokesman for the Katsina Police Command, SP <strong>Gambo Isah,</strong> refuted the claims by saying only 10 were counted dead.</p><p>Isah said that the bandits were on a revenge mission at the village. “The bandits were on a reprisal attack. Ten people were killed in the incident, while 11 others were injured. Recently, members of Yansakai (outlaw local vigilante) have been going round the community, killing the Fulani and the bandits went there on a revenge mission. It is unfortunate. Any member of Yansakai caught henceforth would be treated as bandits. Yansakai remains outlawed in the state,” the police mouthpiece added.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> learnt that the victims of the attack have been laid to rest on Wednesday morning while those who sustained injuries are being treated in the hospital.</p><p>The recent attack is coming two weeks after men of the <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Nigeria Police Force arrested three women in Katsina State for allegedly assisting bandits</strong></a> with petrol, <strong>Naija News</strong> reports.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe49wZpuZnpm2tb%2BMmqutmZOgeqyt06ygp5ldmLyuudSnoK2xXaC2rbiMamdmr5%2BnwKm1z6mcq6tf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./405659-battle-rift-valley-supremacy-gideon-moi-excited-grand-reception-bomet-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Battle for Rift Valley supremacy: Gideon Moi excited after grand reception in Bomet</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rosie-huntington-whiteley-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rosie Huntington-Whiteley - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
