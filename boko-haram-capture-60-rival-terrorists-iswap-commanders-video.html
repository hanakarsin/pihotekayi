captured by <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Boko Haram </a></strong>fighters.</p><p>It was gathered that the ISWAP terrorists were ambushed while on their way to Damasak in Borno State.</p><p>Three of the terrorists captured were revealed as Abubakar Saddiq, Abou Maimuna and Malam Idris; all said to be ISWAP commanders.</p><p>A counter-insurgency expert and security analyst in Lake Chad,<strong> Zagazola Makama</strong>, revealed in a post on his social media platform on Wednesday (today) that the recent supremacy battle between the rival terrorist groups happened on Monday.</p><p>He stated that the Boko Haram Buduma factions, which had the upper hand against ISWAP in the recent turn of events, captured most of the enclaves of ISWAP, which forced them to take refuge in more fortified hideouts in the axis of Kukawa and Madayi and Kwatan Mota.</p><p>“Massive Celebration hits Boko Haram camp after capturing 60 ISWAP fighters including 3 Commanders.</p><p>“On Aug 13, 2023, the Boko Haram faction intercepted about 60 ISWAP terrorists, including three key Commanders, Abubakar Saddiq, Abou Maimuna and Malam Idris, on their way to Damasak.</p><p>“These captives were later taken to an underground prison cell at KWATAN MOTA close to Dogon Chukwu, where they were held as Prisoners of War,” Makama wrote on Twitter.</p><p>See a video below where the said Boko Haram fighters were celebrating their victory over ISWAP:</p><p>In a subsequent post, the security expert shared a video clip showing the moment an alleged Boko Haram commander was praising his fighters for victory over ISWAP terrorists.</p><p>“As we all know, it’s going on our mind, that sometimes if you are overwhelmed with happinesses, there are certain things you wouldn’t be happy if you don’t say it with your mouth, that’s why the person that is representing us, because he was unable to be with us, due to some unforseen circumstances assigned me to visit you, as you know the religion of Islam, is what what brought us together And thankfully we have seen this in you, if there are youths like you, then the infidels will never be happy, for example when we came here to stay in Baga, the infidels were unhappy with this and had made many proposals for Baga to be ravaged by war, they have tried many times, But the Almighty stopped their plan, Because there are men that are not afraid of death, had it been there are men that are afraid of death, then they would have taken over this town, but God by his Grace left it for his servant, And they even lost control of places they have previously held, standing firm by our religion is what made this possible, had it been, when they came, the courage of the Mujahideen have been shattered, they would have come to stay in this town, and they would do what ever that pleases them, he said referring to ISWAP groups,”&nbsp;the terrorists leader was quoted saying.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> understands that infighting has intensified between Boko Haram/ISWAP resulting in hundreds of killings on both sides.</p><p>Both groups have vowed to wage war against themselves than the security forces.</p><p>Barely two weeks ago, ISWAP terrorists reportedly held a mass funeral for jihadists neutralized by the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) jets in the Marte community in Borno State.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> learnt that the terrorists were killed in a series of airstrikes executed by the Air Component of Operation Hadin Kai on July 29, 2023, in Jibularam and Kwalaram between 0830hrs – 0900hrs.</p><p>In a chat with intelligence sources, a Counter-Insurgency Expert and Security Analyst in Lake Chad, Makama, said the terrorists had converged in the areas to coordinate attacks against the Nigerian military before the NAF jets were deployed to engage the terrorists.</p><p>The sources added that both air strikes were positive, with casualties and destruction of ISWAP members and properties.</p><p>According to Makama, the mass burial of the terrorists was carried out on the outskirt of Kwalaram by the surviving fighters.</p><p class=postsid
