This reporter is one of the few lucky media people allowed to pass through, as many others were turned away,” a statement by Ejimakor which was made available to newsmen today noted.</p><p>It added: “It will be recalled that at the two previous hearings of the matter, there was also a sizable number of security agents deployed at the perimeters and premises of the Court, including a large contingent of soldiers.</p><p>“In making the order, the judge noted that he saw no necessity for the deployment of such a high number of security agents to the court, stating that in the future if security agents saw the need to deploy to the court, they should apply to the court for permission to do that.”</p><p>The case was also adjourned by the court to December 10.</p><p>“The matter was adjourned to 10th December for the adoption of processes and a hearing on the substantive application seeking Kanu’s release from detention and his repatriation to Britain. The early date was insisted on by Kanu’s lawyer, Barrister Aloy Ejimakor, who argued that fundamental rights are special cases that must be concluded on time, especially in this instance where Kanu has been in detention since June this year,” the statement added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5ByZpuqlZa4qrrGZpqoraKpeqKwyaisq6ajYruvrcydoGajkaPCtHnCmqqeZZmowLax0mapnqukp66quoytpmaon6G2pLGMqKuhnaKoerC6jJymrqqkYr2zscyiqp6rXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./carter-reum-daughter.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wait, Did Paris Hilton Just Become a Stepmom?
