The couple tied the knot in a beautiful ceremony in Los Angeles surrounded by their friends and family, including <a href=#>Kim Kardashian West</a>, <a href=#>Emma Roberts</a>, <a href=#>Kyle Richards</a>, and <a href=#>Nicole Richie</a>.</p><p>“I feel so lucky and blessed to be yours,” the hotel heiress wrote on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> following their special day. But in the days after, the public learned that Paris might not have just become a wife when she said "I do," but also a stepmom. Keep reading to find out everything we know about Carter Reum’s daughter.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Carter Reum has a daughter with reality TV star Laura Bellizi.</h2><p>On Nov. 15, 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> reported that Carter Reum has a 9-year-old daughter with Laura Bellizi, a former reality star who appeared on VH1's Secrets of Aspen in 2010.</p><p>Laura was romantically linked to actor Mel Gibson in the summer of 2011. A few months after, she debuted a baby bump, and rumors circulated that she was carrying Mel's child.</p><p>However, Laura released a statement at the time confirming that Mel Gibson was not the father. For a decade, the true identity of her baby daddy was never revealed to the public. But four days after Paris Hilton married Carter Reum, the truth came out: Carter was the father.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>A spokesperson for Carter told Page Six: “The people who this story matters to have known about it for 10 years. Carter supports this child. While he does not have a traditional father-daughter relationship with her, he has provided for her since she was born, and will continue to do so.”</p><p>An insider close to the situation told the outlet that Carter has only seen his daughter once since her birth. Despite never taking a paternity test, Carter reportedly did sign a document acknowledging that he was her father in 2020. The mother, Laura, currently lives in California with the young girl. She is originally from Chicago, though, where Carter also hails from.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Carter Reum's daughter feels "left out of her father's life."</h2><p>Upon seeing the flurry of headlines surrounding Paris and her father's wedding, the 9-year-old girl allegedly felt “triggered” and “left out of her father’s life," according to the source who spoke with Page Six. The source continued: "Also, she saw the articles of Paris and Carter talking about starting a family. She felt tremendous rejection and felt left out. She wants to have a relationship with him."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>The articles in question may refer in part to Paris's interview with Tamron Hall in August 2021. Paris told the talk show host that she had frozen her eggs. “I’m just so happy that Carter and I decided to do that literally, like, six months into our relationship. We knew we were forever right away,” she said.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Paris and Carter began dating in November 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6zwMSrZKudpaJ6pa3UoJ%2BtnaI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./carrie-meek-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Carrie Meek - Trivia, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./breaking-court-adjourns-nnamdi-kanus-case-issues-restrain-to-police-others-on-court-premises.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Court Adjourns Nnamdi Kanu's Case, Issues Restrain To Police, Others On Court Premises</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
