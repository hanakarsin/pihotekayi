Remember the not-so-good-old days when people burned CDs for each other to share music? Well, one year, at a Christmas party thrown by her parents, Laura said that a friend of the family arrived with a CD full of what he considered to be the worst Christmas songs ever made.</p><p>On that CD, was the now-infamous Linda Bennett track. But there have been other folks who've maintained, years ago even, that "An Old Fashioned Christmas (Daddy's Home)" is the worst Christmas song ever recorded, like the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Riverfront Times</a> so ardently argued in a 2011 piece on the track.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The outlet even highlighted the efforts of Fox News, which purportedly spent a year attempting to locate Linda Bennett to discuss the song. When Fox was finally able to get in touch with her, she says she didn't even remember recording the song. Which is believable, given the fact that she "had an extensive career in the '50s and '60s, performing on various TV shows and on Bob Hope's USO tour."</p><p>Judging by the sheer number of people who love to hate the song, maybe it's best that Linda forgot it ever existed in the first place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWztdKtpJqrXai8r7OMm6ysZZOnrrS0</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chukwuka-ekweani-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chukwuka Ekweani - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shifty-shellshock-wife.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shifty Shellshock Is Survived by Two Ex-Wives and Three Kids</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
