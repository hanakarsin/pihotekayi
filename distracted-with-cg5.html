The musician went viral on TikTok, specifically for a short audio clip set to a simple tune where he sings "Everybody told me that I sound like CG5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Probably because I am CG5</a>."</p><p>Across his various social media platforms, CG5 has more than 7 million followers and 2.3 million monthly listeners. Though he's been busy gearing up for his upcoming <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Under the Spotlight tour</a>, CG5 took the time to answer 13 quick questions with Distractify.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">What's your most-used emoji?</h2><p><strong>CG5: </strong>I love the blush emoji with the wide-open eyes (üò≥). I use it all the time, especially in stupid conversations that I‚Äôll have with my friends.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">Talk about the best fan interaction you've ever had.</h2><p><strong>CG5:</strong>I think any fan that I meet that says I saved their life with my music really hits differently, especially if it‚Äôs true. It makes me so happy to know I can make such a huge and important impact in their lives.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">What's your favorite color?</h2><p><strong>CG5: </strong>My favorite color is pink. It‚Äôs the manliest color to ever exist, and no one can convince me otherwise.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">If you could have any superpower, what would you pick?</h2><p><strong>CG5: </strong>I would pick teleportation, so I can go to every city that I need to tour in without having to fly on planes for a long time. I‚Äôm a little impatient to get to where I need to go. But aren‚Äôt we all?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@cg5beats href=#>@cg5beats</a><p>I AM CG5!!!!!</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - CG5" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - CG5</a></figure><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">What was the moment you felt like you had "made it"?</h2><p><strong>CG5: </strong>The moment I felt like I made it was my first time that I ever went to VidCon, and I was a guest there. It was crazy to have basically 95 percent of the people at the convention recognizing me wherever I went. It was almost unsafe. I think that‚Äôs when I knew for certain.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">Share your top three desert-island necessities</h2><p><strong>CG5: </strong>My wife, my wife, and my wife.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">Tell us about the first concert you ever attended.</h2><p><strong>CG5: </strong>I went to a benefit concert that the <a href=#>Jonas Brothers</a> did when I was about 12. It was free! But I didn‚Äôt know any of their songs. That‚Äôs definitely changed recently.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CG5</span></figure><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">Share a photo from your camera roll that makes you laugh every time you see it.</h2><p><strong>CG5: </strong>I love this picture because my wife and I are intentionally trying to look uncomfortable in this picture together.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">Have you ever accidentally posted something on social media that you immediately had to delete? What was it?</h2><p><strong>CG5: </strong>So you know the sound on TikTok that goes, ‚ÄúImagine if Ninja got a low taper fade?‚Äù Well, I wanted to create my own variation of that sound. So I went to the mall to get some slim taper cut Levi jeans, and I got my dad to record a video of me singing as follows: ‚ÄúImagine if CG5 got some slim taper jeans.‚Äù I thought I was being hilarious, but quickly realized that it was not funny at all, just kinda awkward, so I deleted it.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">What's your favorite video set to the "I'm CG5" sound you've seen?</h2><p><strong>CG5: </strong>I made my dad make a video to this sound on his own account where it‚Äôs captioned, ‚ÄúEverybody told me that I look like CG5‚Äôs father.‚Äù I was happy to see the video do so well for him, and it was a good bonding experience.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@cg5dad href=#>@cg5dad</a><p>Who is this CG5?</p><a title="‚ô¨ EVERYBODY TOLD ME THAT I SOUND LIKE CG5 - CG5" href=#>‚ô¨ EVERYBODY TOLD ME THAT I SOUND LIKE CG5 - CG5</a></figure><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">How does it feel to be the center of a viral TikTok trend?</h2><p><strong>CG5: </strong>I feel so cool for sounding like CG5. Probably because I am CG5! But in all seriousness, it‚Äôs really awesome to think about how so many people who have never been a fan of me just have my name engraved into their mind now because of this sound that became so annoying because of its overuse. But hey, all publicity is good publicity, that‚Äôs what they say.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">Where do you get inspiration for your music?</h2><p><strong>CG5: </strong>I grew up listening to the 80s constantly, including artists such as Michael Jackson, ELO, Phil Collins, Hall & Oates, Elton John, you name it! I am an 80s connoisseur! So everything I make, I think about the catalog of music that I have collected up in my brain that mostly contains 80s stuff, and it helps me move forward in every one of my music projects very quickly.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">What's your No. 1 distraction?</h2><p><strong>CG5: </strong>My wife. She is my beautiful distraction. I‚Äôm so glad I finally found her because I want her to distract me with her beauty for all eternity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmba0wNGamq2dlGLEqsDHZpqgbQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aita-asking-guests-to-bring-sides-to-a-bbq.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is It Rude to Ask Guests to Bring Sides to a BBQ?
