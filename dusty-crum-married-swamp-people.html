The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">History Channel</a> considers <a href=#>Dusty Crum</a> to be "one of the toughest snake hunters around." So, it makes sense that people want to know more about him, especially a peek into this icon's personal life.</p><p>While his heart seems to be in the swamp, that doesn't mean it can't take a little bit of time and search for love, too, right? Many fans want to know if Dusty is married. Keep reading to find out.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Facebook/Scrap Straps</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Is Dusty Crum from 'Swamp People' married?</h2><p>Dusty has devoted much of his life to hunting pythons and gators. Does he have time to devote to someone else? Well, it turns out he does, but they aren't exactly married yet.</p><p>To balance his love life and work life, it would make sense for Dusty to link up with someone in his field. In this case, he's dating fellow snake hunter Natalee Mckinney.</p><p>Between Swamp People and Guardians of the Glades, Dusty stays busy. Natalee made some appearances on Guardians of the Blades. In one notable episode, they captured a 20-foot-long Burmese python together.</p><p>She has been in Dusty's life for years now and, while they aren't married, their lives are pretty intertwined. In fact, they run a business together — an orchard called Orchid Envy.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Facebook/Natalie Mckinney</span></figure><p>“Natalee was working in a greenhouse in Myakka. She got me hooked,” Dusty told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Observer</a>. “I got interested in the science end of it.” While he's all rough on the edges, he really enjoys this more mild touch of nature.</p><p>“There’s a new color or a new hybrid plant — I want to find the next thing,” he said. “It is like hunting, in a sense,” Dusty explained, but their little business wasn't enough to hold him forever.</p><p>Natalee is the one who inspired Dusty to get into python hunting. She gave him a challenge, which got him out of the house for a while. “I can’t drag him out of bed at 8 a.m., and he left at 4 a.m. this morning [to go back to the Everglades],” she said. “He’s excited. You’re not going to confine him to a 9-to-5 job, ever,”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who is Natalee Mckinney?</h2><p>There's not too much out there about Natalee as she's more lowkey than her boyfriend Dusty. However, we do know that she's a Florida native, moving from Sarasota to Myakka City.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Facebook/Natalee Mckinney</span></figure><p>Natalee lives a similar "hillbilly" lifestyle as her boyfriend, posting lots about the snakes that are running amuck. She's also still promoting the Florida Python Challenge every year, inspiring others to get involved.</p><p>Natalee also enjoys cars and visited a car show on Venice Island in March 2024. She snapped lots of photos of the cars, displaying them on her Facebook.</p><p>When it was time to let go of her own vehicle, it was difficult for her to do. "This little guy has to find a new ride ... scrap yard ... final resting spot ... who’d ever thought getting rid of an old car would make you sad. It was good to me," she wrote on Facebook.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmcK0wNhmmqutnWK6or7RopydZaOsrq68jKmcqKicmg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mateo-kovacic-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mateo Kovacic - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fans-gift-sheggz-all-expense-paid-trip-to-greece-other-expensive-items-on-his-27th-birthday.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fans Gift Sheggz, All-Expense-Paid Trip To Greece, Other Expensive Items On His 27th birthday</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
