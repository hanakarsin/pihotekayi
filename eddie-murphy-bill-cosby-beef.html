As you could probably imagine, the episode was incredible, between a series of unforgettable sketches, Lizzo coming in as the musical guest, and — of course — Eddie's amazing opening monologue.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why do Eddie Murphy and Bill Cosby have beef?</h2><p>At one point during the actor and comedian's monologue, he threw shade at Bill Cosby. And while it simply seemed like a relevant, topical comment, it turns out the two comedians have always hated each other. That's right — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eddie Murphy and Bill Cosby reportedly have beef</a>, and we've done a little sleuthing to find out why.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">They've always had different senses of humor.</h2><p>Apparently, Cosby didn't appreciate Eddie's crude sense of humor. In an episode of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee</a>, Eddie told Jerry Seinfeld about the various lectures he received from the Kids Say The Darndest Things host, deterring him from using inappropriate language and offensive references in his stand-up.</p><p>If you've ever seen Eddie's stand-up comedy, you're probably well-aware of the fact he constantly makes crude sexual references and uses inappropriate language. Cosby, on the other hand, is known for his "family-friendly" stand-up, so it makes sense that they have different views. But why did Cosby feel the need to interject? We'll never know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a><p>Eddie Murphy's first time performing on Johnny Carson's show in 1982.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Eddie constantly felt targeted by Cosby.</h2><p>His crude sense of humor wasn't the only thing Cosby criticized Eddie for — he was often berating him for other things, as well. During Eddie's Comedians in Cars episode, he told Jerry he felt Cosby often targeted him. He told Jerry:&nbsp;</p><p>“He had a weird thing with me that he didn’t have with other comics. It was mean... He wasn’t nice." Murphy said. “He wasn’t doing that with everybody, he was doing that with me specifically. He was s--tty with me.”&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, Cosby had once said to Eddie, “You should come and see how it’s supposed to be done. You shouldn’t get on the stage unless you have something to say.” Was that really necessary? I guess we'll never know.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: GIPHY</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Eddie called out Cosby on SNL... and apparently got in trouble for it.</h2><p>As I said previously, Eddie made a somewhat petty (yet totally justified) joke about <a href=#>Cosby's sexual assault conviction</a> in his opening monologue on SNL, slyly imitating Cosby. He said:&nbsp;</p><p>“If you had told me 30 years ago that I’d be this boring, stay-at-home house dad, and Bill Cosby would be in jail ... even I would have took that bet." [Cosby voice] "Who is America’s Dad now?!”</p><p>And according to The Hollywood Reporter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosby’s publicist responded</a> to Eddie's joke, and it was really weird. They reportedly said:&nbsp;</p><p>"One would think that Mr. Murphy was given his freedom to leave the plantation, so that he could make his own decisions; but he decided to sell himself back to being a Hollywood Slave." So, that's strange.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Eddie's disdain for Cosby totally makes sense — between Cosby's alleged "s--t don't stink" attitude towards the Daddy Day-Care star and his repulsive sexual assault conviction, Cosby definitely deserves all the shade in the world. The message Eddie received from Cosby's publicist was undeniably weird AF, but overall, it seems like Eddie is definitely coming out on top, regardless of the backlash.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmrGltcRmpK6qoJ3Gbq7IpaNmm5%2Bor7p5wZ6cnw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./luke-hemmings-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Luke Hemmings - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./phil-donahue-cause-of-death.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Talk Show Host Dead at 88</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
