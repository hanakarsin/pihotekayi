These days, the multi-talented 29-year-old has clearly branched out — she has since become an author, an actress, and a singer-songwriter.</p><p>Through it all, Gabbie is easily identified by a distinguishable feature: her nose. But did Gabbie get a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">nose job</a> at some point?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Let's take a closer look at what the YouTuber has said about her nose, along with whether or not she's ever gone under the knife to specifically get a nose job.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Gabbie Hanna get a nose job?</h2><p>Honestly, it depends on what you consider a "nose job." Did Gabbie have her nose surgically altered? No — at least not according to what she's publicly shared. However, Gabbie has had fillers and Botox injections in her face and nose in order to help "straighten" it and to correct perceived imperfections.</p><p>In April 2017, Gabbie published a video titled "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I GOT A NOSE JOB!!! (not clickbait)</a>" to her YouTube channel, during which she explained that she had been making a number of changes in her life.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"It started with my body and working out, and I knew I was going to do my hair and I knew I wanted to fix my teeth," she said at the time. "But today is the one that I am the most nervous for and also the most excited for — but definitely 100-percent the most scared for — and it's going to be f---ing with my nose."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Gabbie went on to clarify that she loves her nose despite the constant online hate she receives about it.</p><p>"I love having a prominent nose. I love having a different nose. My nose fits my face. My nose is who I am. My nose sets me apart. My nose defines me," she emphatically stated. "I've always liked my nose and I get so much hate on my nose. And honestly, I don't really get why. I mean, it's definitely bigger than a lot of people's nose, but I like my nose."</p><p>She continued, "I am a Middle Eastern woman and it represents my ethnicity and it looks like the other noses in my family. And I'm proud to be a Lebanese woman, and I don't want to change that about myself. So I don't want to make my nose smaller, and I don't think I'll ever make my nose smaller."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>That's when she finally revealed what she hoped to accomplish by getting a "nose job."</p><p>"However, I would like it if my nose was straight," Gabbie explained. "'Im sure you guys always notice: I always film to my left, everything. And it's because this side I like — I like the shape and everything. And this side, it's collapsed."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Before this video, Gabbie published a bit called "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">THE REASON I'M GETTING A NOSE JOB</a>" in December 2016. The title was actually deceiving, however. That's because the YouTuber mostly read a long and rambling email from a "fan" about how giant her nose is. The "love letter" was sent to her back in 2015, and Gabbie's main message was this: Don't let the haters get to you.</p><p>"I hope you guys know I don't take these things personally. It doesn't hurt my feelings," she said. "And I just wanted to take this minute to say that these things don't matter. Like I know I wanted to share this to be funny, but seriously, this stuff is ridiculous. It does not matter. People say mean things because they're bored — and insecurity."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>Well, there you have it! Yes, Gabbie is aware that internet trolls have some weird obsession with making fun of her nose. Yes, she's had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fillers/Botox injections</a> in order to "straighten her nose" as well as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">filler in her lips</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">liposuction on her neck</a>. (And you know what? Good for her.)</p><p>But no, Gabbie Hanna hasn't had a nose job — at least as far as she's publicly shared.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnK6jrsieZKGZnqOubrrOrJxmop%2BX</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nidcom.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Read All The Latest News About NIDCOM On Naija News</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./transfer-updates-araujo-broja-not-for-sale-obafemi-mazilu-to-go-on-loan-popovic-signs-for-napoli.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Arajo, Broja Not For Sale, Obafemi, Mazilu, To Go On Loan, Popovi Signs For Napoli</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
