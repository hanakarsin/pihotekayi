We can't wait to see how Niall and Chance fit in with the others.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Chance skyrocketed to fame about 10 years ago when his EP, "Acid Rap," gained massive traction. While music is clearly very important to him, so is his faith! It may surprise you to know that he's a very big Christian and this aspect of his life is actually infused in a lot of his music.</p><p>Keep reading for all the details.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Chance the Rapper a Christian?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Chance has been very vocal about his relationship with God and even identifies himself as a "Christian rapper." In an interview for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teen Vogue</a> after his album "Coloring Book" came out, Chance spoke about infusing his faith into the album. Chance confided that, "I don’t make Christian rap, but I am a Christian rapper. When I was going out and trying to fully give glory to God, in my setting, I feared that people would be dismissive of it, like, 'This is Christian rap, I’m not trying to hear it.'"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Despite the fear that Chance had, he said, "People were very accepting of it. Whether they say, 'I’m an atheist, but I love Coloring Book' or they say, 'I’m so glad I was able to get closer to God through this project,' people had formed opinions about what I put into the world. I think that’s always the goal of art."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In addition to his music, Chance also takes to his social media to spread the word of God. In a tweet that he also put on his Instagram celebrating Easter, Chance said, "'The wages of sin are death.' That heavy knowledge right there! All of us are born into sin, BUT the son of God lived a completely sinless life, won the victory over Satan in the garden, and STILL experienced death on the cross. All for us. Tmw I celebrate His victory over death."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Chance even went on a "sabbatical" to learn more about his religion.</h2><p>Back in late 2018, Chance decided to take a step back from his career in order to learn more about the word of God. In an Instagram post, Chance announced that, "I’m on a plane headed out the country on my first sabbatical. I’m going away to learn the word of God which I am admittedly very unfamiliar with. I’ve been brought up by my family to know Christ but I haven’t taken it upon myself to really just take a couple days and read my Bible."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Chance explained, "We all quote scripture and tell each other what God likes and doesn’t like but how much time do we spend as followers of Jesus to really just read and KNOW his Word. I’m definitely guilty of not devoting time to it. So I’m off to read and learn because the next generation of Bennett is here and I need to be able to give my nephew Charlie Matthew the knowledge and tools."</p><p>We respect the discipline so hard, but we are very, very happy to have Chance back in our lives every Monday and Tuesday nights on The Voice. And you know what they say, with God on your side, you can't loose.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBur8eapZydXam1pnnRmqepnaJirm6vx6ugrKyZlrs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./james-harden-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>James Harden - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./carrie-meek-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Carrie Meek - Trivia, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
