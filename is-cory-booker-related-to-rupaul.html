Companies like Ancestry.com and 23andMe have allowed customers to take a deeper dive into their lineage and learn the truth behind their origins.&nbsp;</p><p>Even celebrities have used the technology to learn more about their genealogy, and on an episode of the PBS series Finding Your Roots, <a href=#>RuPaul</a> and former presidential candidate <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cory Booker</a> found out some things about their family tree that left them both in awe.&nbsp;</p><p>Cory also recently appeared on an episode of <a href=#>RuPaul’s Drag Race</a> and referred to the host as his “cousin,” which has led fans to wonder: Are the two actually related? Here’s what we know.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: PBS</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Cory Booker related to RuPaul?</h2><p>Last year, a DNA test revealed that Cory Booker and RuPaul are, in fact, related by a long stretch of DNA.&nbsp;</p><p>After learning the news, RuPaul said on an episode of Finding Your Roots, “He looks like my kin. There’s a sweetness about him that I’ve always loved and an intellect that’s undeniable. But every time I’ve ever seen him, he reminds me of my cousin Yula.”</p><p>Cory was also elated to learn they were related, noting that he is a huge fan of the Emmy Award-winning personality.&nbsp;</p><p>He told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wendy Williams</a>, “So yeah, my mom knows, I just, I love RuPaul, and I haven’t had a chance to talk to him since the news was revealed but I was very happy about that news and I hope that he and I can have a family reunion sometime.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>While Cory and RuPaul only recently learned that they are cousins, they seem to have a close-knit bond already. Not long ago, Cory appeared virtually alongside his newfound family member as a guest on RuPaul’s Drag Race, where he was supposed to announce the rules of the "Lip Sync Smackdown" but instead, shared a sweet message.&nbsp;</p><p>Cory told RuPaul, "Thank you cousin RuPaul. You all already know the rules so I just want to say thank you. In life, we were not born to fit in, we were born to stand out, to make the most out of ourselves and always elevate and enrich the lives of others."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Warner Bros.</span></figure><p>He added, "[Rep.] John Lewis, one of my heroes, said it best: 'Never let anyone, any person or any force, dampen, dim, or diminish your light.' Thank god for you, thank god for America, and thank god for my cousin RuPaul.”</p><p>Along with appearing on RuPaul’s Drag Race, Cory also appeared on an episode of RuPaul’s talk show before they had even learned they were related. Cory tweeted about his experience on the show, “All tea, no shade, @RuPaul stole my look. (Wait, did I do that right?)”</p><p>Cory continued, “Anyway, honored to be one of the first guests on RuPaul's newest show — the #RuPaulShow — today!” &nbsp;</p><p>You can watch new episodes of RuPaul’s Drag Race on Fridays at 8 p.m. EST on VH1.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBur86rsGaan6S4pr6Mq5ylmaSasW7AzmaprqiRqrk%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-do-i-change-my-snapchat-username.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Snapchat Is Finally Letting Us Change Our Cringe Usernames</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./abdullahi-ganduje.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Read All The Latest News About Abdullahi Ganduje On Naija News</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
