Here's what we know so far.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@kathryndennis</a></figure><p>The Season 7 finale of <a href=#>Southern Charm</a> hinted that <a href=#>Kathryn Dennis</a> might be pregnant with her third child. The 30-year-old was filmed taking a pregnancy test and looking nervous as she waited for the results to populate on the device. As the ultimate cliff-hanger, viewers were not privy to whether or not the pregnancy test showed whether or not Kathryn is expecting a baby.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@kathryndennis</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, is Kathryn from 'Southern Charm' pregnant again?</h2><p>Kathryn already has two children with her ex, <a href=#>Thomas Ravenel</a>, so fans were desperate to know if she was expecting a child with her then-boyfriend Chleb Ravenell. Fans initially thought Kathryn looked anything but pregnant, but social media can be deceiving, and most women really don't start showing until they're three or four months pregnant.</p><p>Kathryn does have a reputation for surprising fans with her pregnancies. Back in Season 1, viewers were shocked when they found out she was pregnant after Thomas had broken up with her. Kathryn ended up having a baby girl (Kensie), and she and Thomas tried to make things work. But they broke up again...and lo and behold, Kathryn found out she was pregnant a second time, this time with a boy, their son St. Julien.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kathryn Dennis (@kathryndennis)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@katheryndennis</a></figure><p>Thankfully, as of January 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> helped Kathryn put the rumors to bed once and for all — she's not pregnant! However, things in her and Chleb's relationship did become more serious following the pregnancy rumors. Kathryn gushed about her beau during the Season 8 premiere of Southern Charm on June 23 when the pair quietly moved in together.</p><p>Sadly, their romance on the show was short-lived, and on July 7, the pair broke up seemingly before viewers' eyes. "I feel like you’re emotionally unavailable, and you know I’ve been in relationships with emotionally unavailable people,” Kathryn told Chleb, adding, “I haven’t seen you taking the steps to fulfill the role that I would like someone to fill.”</p><p>Caleb responded, "It’s hard to fill that role, because I didn’t know what I was getting into before dating you."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Chleb Ravenell (@chleb_ravenell)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@chleb_ravenell</a></figure><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a> shortly after the breakup, Chleb revealed that their relationship became strained when filming for Southern Charm began in November 2021, swiftly after the pair officially became a couple. Additional stress was caused by Kathryn's ongoing custody battle with fellow Southern Charm cast member Thomas.</p><p>"Just to see her go through that was painful," Chleb told E! News, explaining that as a solution, he tried to alleviate the pain. "I just wanted to make her happy, but with her dealing with all this, she kind of didn't realize what I was actually trying to do. She had too much going on in her mind."</p><p>Watch new episodes of Southern Charm Thursdays on Bravo at 9 p.m. ET and the next day on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBut8Ctn6uxnmKzs7vMZqqoraSdsrO6jJyfmqqdYr2zscanmKesXZa0orXN</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./olu-jacobs-and-his-wife-joke-silva-share-loved-up-videor.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mercy Johnson, Kaffy, Others Gush As Olu Jacobs And His Wife, Joke Silva Share Loved Up Video</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lisa-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Famous Lisas | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
