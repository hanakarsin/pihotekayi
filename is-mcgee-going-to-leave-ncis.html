Here's what Sean Murray has to say.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>Good news for <a href=#>NCIS</a> fans, <a href=#>Season 17 has just been greenlit</a> and we can hardly wait for it to start in September. But in light of some rumors surrounding Timothy McGee's possible exit from the show, fans are wondering whether they're in for a lot of changes next season. After all, we've been through a lot over the years and it wouldn't be the first time CBS decided to cut a fave from the cast.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus, with McGee being so sketchy about his offer at Splendifida — and telling Kasie not to tell anyone about his package — viewers have been growing more and more concerned. So, is McGee going to leave NCIS?&nbsp;</p><p>Keep reading for what we know and actor Sean Murray's response to the troubling rumors.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, is McGee going to leave NCIS?</h2><p>Fans were worried when the whole storyline with McGee getting recruited to join the Splendifida tech company started playing out, and especially so when he told Kasie not to tell anyone else about his offer. But it seems like that was probably just a classic CBS fake-out to stress fans out!</p><p>If you think about it, it would be pretty insane for someone with such an integral role on the show to leave the team this late in the game. Plus, in the case of past departures, actors usually take to social media to announce they're leaving well ahead of time, so that fans can get their tissues ready.</p><p>A few months ago, actor Wilmer Valderrama — who plays Agent Nicholas Torres — took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> to post a table-read that took place on Wilmer's birthday. Actor Sean Murray, who brings McGee to life on the show, is reading lines with the rest of his cast. So, that's the first when it comes to signs that McGee isn't going anywhere.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sean Murray speaks up against rumors.</h2><p>Hypotheses aside, Sean thankfully spoke to the press to clear up any rumors about his possible departure from the show. First he chatted with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Country Living</a> and told them he was under contract and had "no plans to leave the show," adding "I don't think McGee's going anywhere."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>Sean expanded on this a bit more in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cinemablend</a>. "You know, I think there could be other circumstances in which it would play out," he said about the rumors surrounding his possible departure. "But I also feel that during [One Upon a Time], McGee kind of realizes that where he is is where he belongs."</p><p>"And it was the right decision for him to take this career path," Sean continued. "And I think he's real happy with the people that he's with, so I don't think McGee's going anywhere," he added, rather decisively.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who's coming to and leaving NCIS next season?</h2><p>Now that McGee is safe, fans are wondering about other NCIS mainstays. Luckily, <a href=#>Ducky will be coming back</a> in his part-time role as lead medical examiner. "I am delighted to say that I have reached an agreement with CBS for Dr. Donald Mallard to stay with NCIS for Season 16. Once again, it will be a limited schedule. That arrangement will allow me to spend time with Katherine, our children, six grandsons and Nickie," the actor said last year.</p><p>As for Ziva, she is alive, but we don't see <a href=#>her returning to the team anytime soon.</a> "Unfortunately, because of political things and the scripts not being good enough, I chose not to [stay]," actress Cote de Pablo said around the time of her departure. "I love this character. I worked eight years in crafting this character and loving her, so when I felt or I perceived the character was not being treated with the respect that she deserved, all the money in the world couldn't buy [me]."</p><p>"I love this character.
