Keep reading for <a href=#>Season 4 finale spoilers</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Lucifer Season 4 ending explained:</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>What made Lucifer’s cancellation even more difficult to stomach was the fact that Season 3 ended on a major cliffhanger: Chloe finally seeing her boyfriend as the devil. Season 4 allows us to witness the aftermath of that revelation and how it affects her relationship with Lucifer.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite learning that her partner is the Lord of Hell, Chloe tells Lucifer in Episode 10 that she loves him and is not afraid of his devil face. "I think she’s reacted in line with what I expected before I knew the Season 4 scripts," actress Lauren German, who plays Chloe, recently told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">EW</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"This season for Chloe has been a lot of, 'Imagine you really found out your wife, your girlfriend, your husband were the devil, or an angel, or whatever celestial being you can come up with' — the reality of that. That’s how I tried to ground this crazy mythological show in truth, just playing the realness of what that would be like."</p><p>But, Lucifer ultimately chooses to return to the underworld, leaving the LAPD detective heartbroken. However, his decision to abandon Chloe isn’t as selfish as it sounds. The fallen angel realizes that the prophecy actually predicts hell on Earth once he finds his true love, so if he stayed, demons would come and wreak havoc over mankind.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>The last shot shows Lucifer sitting high on his throne, looking down at the dark kingdom that once again surrounds him.</p><p>Lesley-Ann Brandt, who plays Mazikeen on the series, previously teased the "epic, epic, epic cliffhanger," telling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Life</a>, "If you thought the Season 3 cliffhanger was big, this one is pretty amazing."</p><p>The actress added that she can’t imagine the cast not returning for a fifth season. "Fans are going to be salivating and begging for more absolutely," she shared. "I mean, I feel like we’re going to break the Internet and possibly break Netflix. They [the fans] are going to let their voices be known to Netflix."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, is there going to be a Season 5 of Lucifer?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Netflix hasn’t announced their future plans for the show, but it could go either way at this point. Even if this is the end of the road, it sounds like the cast is grateful to have had the opportunity to try something new thanks to their switch to the streaming platform.</p><p>"I feel like the scripts have gotten so much better," Lauren admitted to EW. "Just because we’re doing 10 [episodes], there’s more in each one. We can cuss a little bit. All of the [stories] can be scarier, darker, things Fox wouldn’t allow. When fans see Season 4, I think they’re going to be really pleasantly surprised and pleased. It’s just faster and darker."</p><p>Binge Season 4 of Lucifer on Netflix now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuwMeeqZ5ll6S2r7OMraZmmpViwKat0qilZm1docKktcWeqQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./biafra-nnamdi-kanu-issues-important-message-to-ipob-members.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nnamdi Kanu Issues Important Message To IPOB Members</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ginny-lemon-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ginny Lemon - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
