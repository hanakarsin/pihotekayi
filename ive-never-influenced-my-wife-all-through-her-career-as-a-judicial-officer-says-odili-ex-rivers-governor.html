But that does not also mean that even you in the judiciary should not keep your house in order. That is the truth.”</p><p>At the event, Chief Justice of Nigeria, <strong>Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad</strong>, described Justice Odili, as an epitome of dignity, hard work, fairness and excellence.</p><p>Represented by <strong>Justice Kudirat Kekere-Ekun</strong>, of the Supreme Court, he said Justice Odili remains an inspiration to the girl child.</p><p>“My lord has shown what is possible with diligence, hard work and integrity. Through you we see that the sky is the limit.”</p><p>However, ahead of the 2023 polls, Wike is urging state High Courts to abide by the provisions of the new Electoral Act, which prohibits them from handling pre-election or electoral matters. According to the governor, some State High Courts are already acting in contravention of the law.</p><p>“The truth is that the Electoral Act says anything about pre-election or electoral matters, is now to be decided by the Federal High Court.”</p><p>He declared that he will remain eternally grateful to Justice Odili, for creating the opportunity for him to meet her husband and former governor when he ventured into active partisan politics in 1998.</p><p>The governor reiterated that there is no politician serving at the federal or state level since 1999 that will deny the fact that they did not pass through the tutelage Odili.</p><p>He said despite the generosity of Odili and his family, some of those whom they had helped politically, have regrettably betrayed and humiliated them.</p><p>“I have never seen a man who has suffered humiliation, I have never seen a man who has suffered betrayal in life like Odili.”</p><p>Governor Wike further explained that Odili’s insistence that someone from the Ikwerre extraction should succeed him as governor in 2007, earned him some enemies.</p><p>“Dr. Odili biggest problem in this state today, people must know the truth, is because he said Ikwerre man must become governor, that’s it. If any man tells you that Odili has committed any other sin, it’s a lie. It’s just because he said Ikwerre man must become governor.</p><p>“Unfortunately, we the Ikwerre people whom he said should be governor are ones that put him in the witness box. But I want to appeal to him, forgive, you are a Christian. You are a Christian, forgive all of us.”</p><p>Governor Wike, who recalled how the Odili family suffered blackmail and humiliation because of him, vowed never to grieve or engage in act that will bring them into disrepute.</p><p>He reaffirmed that Odili’s fatherly counsel has been one of the reasons why he has succeeded in the governance and transformation of Rivers State since 2015.</p><p>Continuing, Odili said, “when I finished being governor and went to Abuja to spend time with her, and a lot of political cases as you know were rolling over each other. All my friends in Abuja know and they tell each other, the moment you have case either at the Court of Appeal when she was there or at the Supreme Court, the access you use to have to come as a personal friend cease until the case is over.”</p><p>Odili thanked Governor Wike and the people of Rivers State for honouring his wife after 44 years of meritorious service in the judiciary.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5BwZqKulWK7psLEq2Sippahwqa6wp6bZqWpYsSqssRmmKWkXam1s7vUoJ9moJWneqSt0Z6cq2WRqHqiecmum6KbmZa5brvFn6CcnaJiwKLF0mamnaGcnnqmxIyroK%2Bdoqh6qLvVnqmnp6Jk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./joe-rogan-controversy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Joe Rogan &amp;quot;Controversy&amp;quot; About Endorsing Bernie Sanders Explained</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./405341-crowd1-explained-rewards-payouts-owner-rights-a-scam-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Crowd1 explained: rewards, payouts, owner rights, is it a scam?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
