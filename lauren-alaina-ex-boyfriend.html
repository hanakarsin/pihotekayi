"I am single for the first time as an adult, so I am not trying to hurry love. I will say that I am enjoying it," she said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Billboard</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Reportedly, Lauren and her ex split in September of that same year after having dated for four months, but he was later accused of sexual assault from multiple women. Even though he denied them, the allegations still follow him. But now, fans think she's speaking out about her relationship with him and that even her latest single is about their relationship.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Lauren Alaina ex-boyfriend?</h2><p>From June to September, Lauren dated Christian comedian John Crist. He's got over one million followers across all of his social media platforms and is probably most known for his sketches about being a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christian shopper</a>. In November, John was accused by five women of sexual assault.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"The allegations include, but are not limited to, individually sexting multiple women during the same time period, initiating sexual relationships with married women and women in committed relationships, offering show tickets in exchange for sexual favors, and repeatedly calling these women late at night while drunk," according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charisma News</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>One woman who used the fake name Kate told the publication that she was "truly blinded by his celebrity status" and that she trusted that John wouldn't do anything wrong because he's a Christian. But that was not the case. She says he got her drunk and tried to kiss her, among other things, while she was intoxicated.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans think Lauren's latest single is about her relationship with John.</h2><p>In April 2021, fans started to believe that some of her tweets were about her relationship with John. In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one tweet</a>, she shares a screenshot of a message she got from someone who said they were dating the same guy, although the name is marked out.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr>❤️ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/dUI2IUCGQd</a></p>— Lauren Alaina (@Lauren_Alaina) <a href=#>April 26, 2021</a></figure><p>Lauren captioned the post saying, "To all the women who have sent me these messages, I see you. I’m sorry you went through it as well. I wish I had spoken up for you all before now. I will find a way."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In another tweet</a>, she says, "It’s never too late to speak your truth. I’m ready."</p><p>Lauren also released a song with Jon Pardi called "Getting Over Him," which she said was about a public breakup. But it's not clear if the song is about John or her relationship with ex-fiancé Alex Hopkins.&nbsp;</p><p>Alex and Lauren broke up back in January 2019, although fans think her new song about John. When she talked about the break-up with Alex, she made it seem as if they had just grown apart. "We started dating at 17, and we’re now 24 years old," she said to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taste of Country</a>. "We’re very different people, and we have different goals, and we want to go different places in life. When we got engaged, it got really real."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoa62vsSnZJqkkZ67onnEsWSbp6mbv6qxzZ0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./388685-im-rich-enough-to-afford-my-lifestyle-lizzy-anjorin-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Im Rich Enough To Afford My Lifestyle Lizzy Anjorin</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./400606-chama-cha-bobi-wine-chashinda-viti-41-vya-umeya-huku-cha-museveni-kikipoteza-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chama cha Bobi Wine chashinda viti 41 vya umeya huku cha Museveni kikipoteza</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
