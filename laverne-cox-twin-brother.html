For one, <a href=#>she has an identical twin brother</a> who has a full-on artistic career in his own right.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Laverne has always been a performer.</h2><p>On Laverne's own website, the star and activist writes about how seeing Candis in Dirty Sexy Money "changed the course" of her life. "That moment was so pivotal for me: after being in New York pursuing a career as an actress for many years, I now knew it was possible to be openly trans and have a career," she writes. "That possibility model shifted my belief system."</p><p>Laverne started performing when she was a child. "I started studying dance when I was 8 years old in Mobile, Alabama, and was performing in dance recitals and talent shows by the time I was in third grade," she writes. "My childhood was filled with dreams of fame and performing in television and movies, and on Broadway and the great stages of the world."</p><p>Flash forward some years, and the Orange Is the New Black star's dreams have become a reality. She owes a lot of that to her mother, the star has said in interviews, who despite wishing that she and her identical twin brother would become doctors and lawyers, completely "supported our artistic dreams." "I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for my mom," the star revealed on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>I never thought I would grow my eyebrows out but here we are.

Lamar, who plays her character pre-transition.</p><p>The twins are very close, and both went on to pursue artistic careers. Today, after attending the prestigious San Francisco Art Institute and Yale's studio art MFA, M. Lamar is a musician and multimedia artist who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wants</a> his work to be "visible to certain musical subcultures and deviant undergrounds."</p><p>He's shown and performed internationally, and his talents as a performance artist have been applauded by legends such as Hilton Als and Ron Athey.</p><p>Laverne calls M. her "moral compass," and shared an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">anecdote</a> with Conan O'Brien about her musical twin that tells you all you need to know about their relationship. "He was on a radio show and he was doing an interview and he was telling this story about how he was on the subway once and someone came up to him and said, 'Are you Laverne Cox from Orange Is the New Black?'," the actress recalls.</p><p>"He told the guy interviewing him that I was offended when he told me this story that someone thought that I was a man because my brother is clearly a guy," she continued, "and he said that he was offended that someone thought he was an actor. That's my brother. I love him."</p><p>Follow M.
