The 53-year-old was apparently also known as Lisa Holden, Lisa Howell, Lisa Jeanine Sullins, Gregory Naussany, Kurt Naussany, and Carolyn Williams.</p><p>"As alleged in the complaint, the defendant orchestrated a scheme to conduct a fraudulent sale of Graceland, falsely claiming that Elvis Presley‚Äôs daughter had pledged the historic landmark as collateral for a loan that she failed to repay before her death,‚Äù said Nicole M. Argentieri, principal deputy assistant attorney general and head of the Justice Department‚Äôs Criminal Division, per the DOJ.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>A Missouri woman was arrested this morning on federal charges in connection with an alleged scheme to defraud Elvis Presley‚Äôs family of millions of dollars and steal the family‚Äôs ownership interest in Graceland, the former home of Elvis Presley.</p><p>üîó: <a href=#>https://t.co/lQTqfimrXE</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/XknkSdQsf4</a></p>‚Äî Criminal Division (@DOJCrimDiv) <a href=#>August 16, 2024</a></figure><p>"As part of the brazen scheme, we allege that the defendant created numerous false documents and sought to extort a settlement from the Presley family," she continued. "Now she is facing federal charges. The Criminal Division and its partners are committed to holding fraudsters to account."</p><p>So what exactly did Findley supposedly do, exactly? Buckle up, because it's a doozy.</p><p>First she reportedly posed as three different people from a fake private lender called Naussany Investments. She allegedly created a whole bunch of fake loan documents indicating that <a href=#>Lisa Marie Presley (who died in 2023)</a> had borrowed $2.8 million from the company in 2018, and even forged Lisa's signature along with a Florida notary public's.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Lisa Findley arrested on 47th anniversary of Elvis Presley's death!<br>She is said to be behind plot w/ Graceland foreclosure in May, according U.S. Dept of Justice.

So when Findley claimed Lisa Marie didn't pay back this supposed loan, Findley reportedly tried to "settle" the matter by seeking $2.85 million from the Presleys.</p><p>Then, Findley apparently filed a false creditor's claim with the California Superior Court, along with a fake deed of trust with the county register's office in Memphis.</p><p>But she wasn't done yet, allegedly. She then reportedly put out a fake foreclosure notice in a daily Memphis newspaper called The Commercial Appeal, with claims that Naussany Investments was going to auction off Graceland in May 2024.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>She's probably All Shook Up this morning.. Uh huh-huh.</p>‚Äî Richard (Mr. Dick) Stewart (@stewart_richard) <a href=#>August 16, 2024</a></figure><p>When the Presley family then sued Naussany Investments, Findley allegedly submitted fake court filings. And after the media caught wind of the whole ordeal, Findley reportedly wrote letters to the Presleys, the media, and the Tennessee state court in which she blamed the whole thing on an identity thief in Nigeria.</p><p style=text-align:start>Now, Findley has been charged with mail fraud and aggravated identity theft. If she's convicted, she faces a maximum of 20 years behind bars for the mail fraud, and a minimum of two years for the identity theft.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoba0rYyjnJqmmaOybrLIp5ulnalitLOtwp6jmqaUYq6zvsSsqw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bold-and-the-beautiful-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Bold and the Beautiful</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./laura-makayla-laura-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Laura &amp;amp; Makayla Laura - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
