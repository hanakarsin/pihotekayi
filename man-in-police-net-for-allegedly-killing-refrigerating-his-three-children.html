Enugu State Command of the <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Nigeria Police</strong></a> Force has arrested one Ifeanyi Amadikwa for allegedly killing his three children.</h2><p>A police report made available to newsmen on Wednesday alleged the 53-year-old man murdered his biological children and refrigerated their remains.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> understands that the suspect, a resident of 74 Nkwubor Road, Emene near Enugu, was arrested on January 4 at about 7:30 PM.</p><p>Confirming the arrest of the suspect, the Command’s Public Relations Officer, ASP <strong>Daniel Ndukwe</strong>, said Amadikwa was arrested by police operatives attached to Enugu Metro Police Area Command.</p><p>According to the police spokesman, the three female children he murdered are Chidalum Amadikwa,11 (who is his step-daughter), Amarachi Amadikwa, 8, and Ebubechukwu Amadikwa, 4.</p><p>The police statement said: “Preliminary investigation showed that the suspect’s wife and mother of the children, went to the market with her only male child on Jan. 4, leaving the others in the suspect’s custody.</p><p>“She, however, came back in the evening hours of the said date and could not find any of the three children.</p><p>“But while searching for them, the suspect drew her attention to the said fridge he had brought back home from his shop on Jan. 2 and kept in their apartment’s veranda.</p><p>“And on a closer observation, the lifeless bodies of the children were found in the fridge with bruises, suggesting that they might have been murdered and dumped in the fridge,” he said.</p><p>Ndukwe said that the bodies of the deceased children were immediately moved to the hospital, where they were confirmed dead by medical doctors on duty and deposited in the mortuary for preservation and autopsy.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> understands that the State Commissioner of Police, Mr <strong>Lawal Abubakar</strong> has been involved in the matter.</p><p>In his reaction to the disturbing development, Abubakar commiserated with the mother, relatives and friends of the deceased children.</p><p>The police spokesman said that the commissioner had assured commitment to thoroughly investigate the case and ensure that justice prevails.</p><p>“Given this, the commissioner has ordered the Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of State Criminal Intelligence and Investigation Department to conduct a conclusive investigation into the case and ensure everyone found culpable is brought to book,” he added.</p><p class=postsid
