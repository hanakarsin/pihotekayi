So, what exactly happens in the <a href=#>ending</a> of this big-budget action thriller?&nbsp;</p><p>Keep scrolling while we <a href=#>explain</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: lionsgate</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'The Marauders' ending, explained.</h2><p>Marauders is an action thriller featuring an ensemble cast of talented actors. <a href=#>Christopher Meloni</a> (Law & Order: SVU) stars as Special Agent Jonathan Montgomery who is leading the investigation into a string of violent bank robberies and its special task force within the Cincinnati PD.</p><p>Joining Montgomery on the investigation are also his deputy, Agent Stockwell, played by Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Special Agent Wells, played by Adrian Grenier (The Devil Wears Prada).</p><p>After four masked robbers steal $3 million dollars from Hubert International Bank and execute the bank manager, Steven Hutchinson, the FBI forensics team finds a bullet at the crime scene with the fingerprint of a dead Army ranger named T.J. Jackson.&nbsp;</p><p>According to official reports, Jackson and his team had gone rogue a few years earlier and kidnapped Alexander Hubert for ransom.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: lionsgate</span></figure><p>But the kidnapping went wrong and the Rangers ended up being killed along with Alexander. This led the only remaining heir, Alexander’s brother Jeffrey Hubert, played by Bruce Willis (Die Hard), to take over as president of Hubert International.&nbsp;</p><p>After a second heist and another bullet with T.J.’s fingerprint is found, Agent Montgomery also receives photo evidence of a possible affair between Hubert and Ohio Senator Cook. Then the robbers themselves contact Montgomery and urge him to look into Hubert’s corruption.&nbsp;</p><p>Following a third heist, Montgomery is sent yet another file. This time, the file is also leaked to the media and audiences learn that Jeffrey Hubert had conspired with Senator Cook to prevent brother Alexander from taking over the bank. It turns out that it was Jeffrey and the senator who briefed the Ranger team with false information, leading them to kidnap Alexander.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: lionsgate</span></figure><p>Thinking they had gone rogue, Special Forces were sent in to neutralize the Ranger team. But it turns out that their leader T.J. was the sole survivor, saved by then-Special Forces sniper Wells!&nbsp;</p><p>It’s revealed that FBI Special Agent Wells is actually the leader of the bank robbers and had planned the heists as revenge for the Ranger massacre that he regretfully took part in.</p><p>After Montgomery unsuccessfully tries to bring down Hubert and Cook through legal channels, he convinces Wells to release the evidence to the press. At this point, Hubert flees the country. But there’s more.</p><p>Montgomery manages to track Hubert down in Mexico but when he arrives at the restaurant where he believes Hubert will be, he runs into Wells getting ready to kill Hubert himself. After a lengthy conversation, Montgomery manages to convince Wells to use the stolen money to help others and let go of his need for revenge.</p><p>Wells agrees but in the next scene, audiences see Montgomery confront and stab Hubert with a concealed blade. As Hubert’s bodyguard tries to shoot Montgomery, Wells guns him down thereby saving Montgomery’s life. The two men briefly lock eyes before they silently go their separate ways.</p><p>Stream Marauders on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6zrdSdnKurXZq7pbXNoGSesKChrqq6xJ0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lydia-violetta-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lydia Violeta - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./blake-gibbon-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Blake Gibbons - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
