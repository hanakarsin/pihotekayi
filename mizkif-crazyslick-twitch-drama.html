CrazySlick allegedly followed her and her friends around "trying to kiss me, trying to kiss her, and at one point I was told that he and I ended up kissing."</p><p>"Apparently I was passed out in one of the rooms at the party and he came into the room while I was unconscious. He came into the room a couple of times after being asked to leave me alone each time, in two of those instances he touched my neck and chest saying he was: 'just making sure I was alive' after being assured by my friends that I was okay as they were watching over me," she continued. "Whether or not his intentions were out of genuine concern or not, I don't know. To be clear: He did not rape me or assault me, but his actions DID make me uncomfortable."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Mizkif allegedly helped CrazySlick cover the allegations against him.</h2><p>Though CrazySlick is at the center of these allegations, Mizkif and his ex-girlfriend, Maya, allegedly helped to cover up the accusations against their friend.</p><p>"Let me be even more clear, Mizkif didn't assault the women, he orchestrated the cover ups for his friends, exactly how my Tweet reads," Trainwreck followed up in another tweet.</p><p>Some Redditors have also posted clips of Mizkif allegedly talking about the instance, downplaying it during a livestream.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Mizkif, I brought you into this world and now I'm taking you out <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/5ZkDcB2jsA</a></p>— Ice_Poseidon (@REALIcePoseidon) <a href=#>September 20, 2022</a></figure><p>"It's sexual harassment, whatever, on a low scale," he said in the clip that's circulating.
