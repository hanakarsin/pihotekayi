The incident happened in 2002, and several witnesses have since recanted the stories they told at his trial. In spite of that, Miller has been unsuccessful in his attempts to get a new trial.&nbsp;</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>Miller's case has received new interest in part because of the No Limit Chronicles, which is airing weekly on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BET</a>. He was sentenced to life in prison at the Louisiana State Penitentiary. In January of last year, a judge deemed the two witnesses who had recanted their testimony unreliable and denied Miller's motion for a new trial. The witnesses said that Miller was not the shooter, and that they felt pressured to lie under oath. Now, he has advocates fighting for his release.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>@cmurder & I are bonded by truth, honesty & Loyalty !

She has teamed up with Kim Kardashian and others to fight for his release.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What has Kim Kardashian said about Corey Miller?</h2><p>In a series of tweets posted on Aug. 16, Kim came to Miller's defense. "The jury convicted Corey 10-2 and he was sentenced him [sic] to life in prison. If his trial was today, the jury would have had to be unanimous for him to be convicted," Kim wrote. "Since his trial, witnesses have recanted, new evidence of his potential innocence has come to light, and there are claims of jurors being pressured into voting to convict."&nbsp;</p><p>"True justice for the young man requires that the person who actually killed him be held responsible and that Corey Miller be returned home to his kids," she continued. In the past, Kim has proven she is capable of effecting change. She successfully <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lobbied the president</a> for the release of Alice Johnson. Now, she's turned her attention to Miller's case.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforyvtcKaZJqmlGKwsL7EsmSmoZyhsrN50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMip</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rybka-twins-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rybka Twins - Members, Ages, Trivia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./imogen-sheeran-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Imogen Sheeran - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
