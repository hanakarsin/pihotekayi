Every Nigerian student that the ASUU strike has sent home should block all the Federal roads and the office of the Minister of Education and the office of the Minister of Labour should also be blocked. If Nigerian students are at home, office of the Minister of Education and Minister of Labour cannot be opened.”</p><p>Asefon lampooned the government, said it was playing hide and seek with ASUU since 1999 when they signed the agreement with the academic union.</p><p>“NANS is not going to stand by and watch the government destroy tertiary education in the country,” Adedayo is quoted as saying.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Minister of Education, <strong>Adamu Adamu</strong> had said the <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>decision by ASUU to embark on strike came to him as a surprise.</strong></a></p><p>This is as he claimed the union went on strike while negotiations were still ongoing and the government was already attending to their matters.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that the Minister stated this during a chat with State House correspondents last week Wednesday after the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting in Abuja.</p><p>Adamu said the government had already set up a committee to review the demands and position of ASUU when suddenly the union announced strike action.</p><p>“ASUU, unfortunately, has gone on strike and I am looking for them because all the issues are being addressed.</p><p>“The last thing that happened was that our committee looked at their demands, but there are renegotiations going on. They submitted a draft agreement which the ministry is looking at,” Adamu said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5FqZqeZnqh6qr%2FSrpysZZ%2Bjsm7DxJ6iZq2cqbaurdOupGasn2KzqHnArKyuZaSkeqa6w2aqraqZoLJw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./igbo-group-hails-baba-ahmed-over-comment-on-peter-obi.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Igbo Group Hails Baba-Ahmed Over Comment On Peter Obi</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./june7-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>June 7 Birthdays | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
