Paul and Edie said “I do” in 1992, and went on to have three children together. More about them in a moment.</p><p>Paul and Edie enjoyed a relatively low-key marriage until 2014, when a domestic disturbance at their New Canaan, Conn. home made national headlines, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. The husband and wife were both arrested over what was later described as a “rare argument.” Their lawyer Allan Cramer also said about the head-scratching incident, the details of which are still, unclear, “On a scale of one to 10, it was a one,” per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Incidentally, Paul and Edie sold their Connecticut home, where the scandalous incident took place, in July of 2022 for upwards of $10 million, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stamford Advocate</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Paul Simon has four children, and half as many ex-wives.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Before Paul coupled up with Edie, he was married to Peggy Harper from 1969 until 1975.
