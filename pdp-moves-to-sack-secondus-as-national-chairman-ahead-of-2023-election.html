He has not lived up to expectations. And we’re afraid that our great party would not make the expected impact in 2023 if we retain Secondus as national chairman”, the source who did not want to be named told The Nation.</p><p>“There were also allegations of financial mismanagement brought against him. And we needed explanations, which we are yet to receive. There was so much tension, and it was clear many stakeholders in the party wanted Secondus out.</p><p>“He has been unable to manage the simmering crisis in the party, some chapters in the north are barely hanging on by a thread. Even in the south west, some prominent members are at war with each other, and the only reason the party has not imploded there is because of their strong faith in the party.</p><p>“Secondus has also failed to manage the situation. We think he just has to leave so we can reposition the party for 2023,” the source added.</p><p>He further revealed that on Tuesday, during the NWC meeting, there were heated debates by members of the need to replace Secondus as party chairman.</p><p>The tension-soaked meeting however was inconclusive but officials tried to calm flaring tempers of the members.</p><p>Meanwhile, former <strong>President Goodluck Jonathan</strong> on Tuesday <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>met with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Reconciliation and Strategy Committee</a></strong> led by former Senate President, <strong>Sen. Bukola Saraki</strong>.</p><p>Other members of the committee include one-time Senate President, Anyim Pius Anyim, and ex-governor of Cross River State Liyel Imoke as members.</p><p>Former Gombe Governor Ibrahim Dankwambo; ex-Katsina Governor Ibrahim Shema and Hon. Mulikat Akande.</p><p>Speaking to newsmen after the meeting, Saraki said the committee sought Jonathan’s counsel on how to go about strengthening the party, by reconciling aggrieved members.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ze5BwZqmcoGK6sMLErGStp12orqS3jKycnKeemcK0ecCsZKeZpJ68r63LZpqhmZmnuqK6jJqfnpmUYryneZFpaWxllaGypMDIqKVo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./flintstones-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Flintstones (Show) - Cast, Ages, Trivia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./just-in-efcc-rearrest-instagram-big-boy-mompha.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>EFCC Rearrest Instagram 'Big Boy' Mompha</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
