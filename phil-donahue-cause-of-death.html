He was surrounded by his loved ones, including his wife of 44 years, actress <a href=#>Marlo Thomas</a>, his sister, his children, grandchildren, and his cherished golden retriever, Charlie.</p><p>Phil Donahue is widely regarded as one of the most influential talk show hosts in history, earning the title "King of Daytime Talk." He began his career as a production assistant at KYW radio and television in Cleveland. Phil then progressed to roles as a morning anchor at WHIO-TV in Dayton, Ohio, and as a radio announcer on WHIO radio.</p><p>In November 1967, Phil left WHIO to create and host The Phil Donahue Show, which later became known simply as Donahue. The show, which aired for 29 seasons and concluded in 1996, was remarkably groundbreaking for its innovative format that featured audience participation.</p><p>Phil married Margaret Cooney in 1958, and they had five children: Michael, Kevin, Daniel, Mary Rose, and James. The couple divorced in 1975.</p><p>Phil later married actress Marlo Thomas on May 21, 1980, whom he had met on his talk show in 1977. They did not have any children together.</p><p>He is survived by his wife, Marlo Thomas; his sister; four of his children — Michael, Kevin, Daniel, and Mary Rose; and his grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his youngest son, James "Jim" Patrick, who died in 2014 at the age of 51 from an aortic aneurysm.</p><p>Our thoughts are with Phil's family, friends, and fans during this difficult time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbWquIydpqeZmKqybq%2FArqqeZZ%2BbeqWxwK2f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./eddie-murphy-bill-cosby-beef.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Here's Everything We Know About Eddie Murphy &amp;amp; Bill Cosby's Beef</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rjk-jr-health.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>RFK Jr.'s Health Is in Question After a Brain Worm Was Found</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
