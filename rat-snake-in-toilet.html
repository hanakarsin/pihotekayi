But after watching this viral <a href=#>TikTok</a> video that has given me the heebie jeebies, I am definitely taking some precautions before using any toilet ever again.</p><p>Previously, I used to think that the craziest thing that could ever happen to me while doing my business was that I would <a href=#>unexpectedly give birth to a baby while on the toilet</a> (which has actually happened to several women on <a href=#>TLC’s</a> I Didn’t Know I Was Pregnant). However, this TikTok video has really unlocked a new fear for me, and will probably do the same for you.</p><p>Let’s take a look at what this woman found in her toilet after taking a pee.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Stock photo</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A woman was aghast after finding a 5-foot rat snake inside her toilet.</h2><p>A woman named Christina (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@missycina</a>) shared a video to TikTok showing what she discovered in her toilet after taking a pee.</p><p>In absolute hysterics, she is heard screaming, “Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, I just peed, I just peed," while recording from the corner of her bathroom.</p><p>Christina then gingerly approaches the toilet to show viewers the 5-foot yellow <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rat snake</a> just chilling like a villain inside her toilet bowl.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@missycina href=#>@missycina</a> <a title="♬ original sound - Christina Phillip998" href=#>♬ original sound - Christina Phillip998</a></figure><p>Users couldn’t just scroll by this video, which has over 17 million views as of writing, without leaving a comment.</p><p>“I’m laughing but this is a legit genuine fear of mine,” wrote one person.</p><p>Another teased, "That snake probably thought that was the spiciest rain he has ever experienced," referring to Christina's pee.</p><p>"This is why I check every time before sitting, 'cause it actually happens, " someone else said.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: tiktok</span></figure><p>Meanwhile, others applauded Christina for her braveness. “Ngl the realization of a snake after peeing would have killed me instantly. Like I would not have recovered from that. [You’re] better than me," read one comment.</p><p>And if everyone wasn’t already freaked out, one person commented on Christina’s video that they once had a flying squirrel in their toilet.</p><p>In a follow-up video, an unidentified arm held the snake up vertically parallel to Christina to compare their heights. While Christina had a few inches on the snake, it was clear that this was one long reptile.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: tiktok / @missycina</a></figure><p>After watching that video, some users assumed that Christina killed the snake and began scolding her in the comment section. However, it wasn't inherently clear if that's what actually happened.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Earth.com</a>, rat snakes — like the one found in Christina's toilet — are typically non-venomous.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Can a snake actually come through your toilet?</h2><p>While Christina’s video should be enough evidence to conclude that yes, snakes sure can slither up your pipes and appear in your toilet, we understand it’s the internet and you might be skeptical to trust every video you see.</p><p>That said, Christina’s video seems very much real and not staged. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aztec Plumbing & Drains</a>, animals can indeed crawl out of toilets, with the most common being snakes, frogs, and rodents. In Christina's situation, it appears the snake entered through her sewer system. Given the time of the year, this tall slimy guy was probably trying to beat the heat and gravitated toward the pipes where it was cooler.</p><p>Generally speaking, this is a very rare occurrence.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp661edKnmKSdXZ67bsDOoqOerA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./finally-niger-govt-approves-mohammed-barau-kontagora-as-new-sarkin-sudan.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Finally, Niger Govt Approves Mohammed Barau Kontagora As New Sarkin Sudan</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./just-in-tinubu-meets-senators-elect-rep-members-elect-behind-closed-door-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tinubu Meets Senators-elect, Rep Members-Elect Behind Closed-Door [Photos]</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
