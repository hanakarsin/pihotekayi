The <a href=#>2022 defamation trial of Chyna vs. the Kardashian family</a> has been a huge talking point since it started.</p><p>Since everyone has questions about what's going on with the court case, fans are curious to learn more about Rob's failed relationship with Chyna. When exactly did they start dating, and when did they permanently call it quits? Here's a breakdown of their timeline.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna went Instagram official in January 2016.</h2><p>In January 2016, Chyna let the whole world know she was in a relationship with Rob by posting an affectionate pic on Instagram. In the post, she's being embraced by a heavily tattooed arm that belongs to none other than the youngest Kardashian. The photo came as quite a shock to fans on both sides. About a month later, Chyna posted a photo of her hand adorned with a diamond ring, which sparked big-time engagement rumors.</p><p>In March 2016, Chyna and Rob made it clear to everyone that they had broken up, after he deleted all images of her from his Instagram. As for Blac Chyna, she posted a meme alluding to the split.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Black Chyna and Amber Rose</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna got engaged in April 2016.</h2><p>Rob and Chyna reconciled at some point between March and April 2016. While they were spotted out and about, fans quickly noticed Chyna's massive diamond ring.</p><p><a href=#>Amber Rose</a> seemingly confirmed the engagement by posting a message on Instagram, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>. She wrote, "Congratulations to my family @blacchyna and @robkardashian!!! Please don't let nothing or no one tear u guys apart! I never seen my sis so happy and I couldn't be more happy for her!

The following month, they announced they'd be getting married in the summer of 2017.</p><p>But on Dec. 17, 2016, Rob posted a Snapchat revealing that the relationship was over –– and that Chyna had moved out with Dream. He said, "I'm pretty upset and I'm pretty sad. Because it's about to be Christmas and I want to be with my baby." Three days later, on Dec. 20, 2016, they got back together.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Blac Chyna was spotted with another man in February 2017.</h2><p>In February 2017, Chyna was spotted out with another man –– and was no longer wearing her engagement ring.

Everything isn't always going to be peaches and cream. If it is, then it's fake. I'm in it for the long haul."</p><p>On April 1, 2017, Rob and Chyna revealed they were back together with a series of lovey-dovey Snapchat videos –– but the reconciliation didn't last very long. On July 5, 2017, Rob accused Chyna of infidelity and posted explicit photos of her on social media. She responded with claims of physical abuse. They never got back together after this split, but proceeded to face plenty of legal issues.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Since 2017, Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna have had a lot of legal troubles.</h2><p>Rob petitioned for his child support payments to be lowered and was met with backlash from Chyna. She claimed she wasn't getting a lot of financial support from Rob or Tyga. Now, she's battling it out in court against Rob and the rest of his family members over the cancelation of her and Rob's reality TV show, Rob & Chyna. The results of the case haven't been brought to light just yet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7yjecqaqZ2Zo522orqMm6Oam12Ytbq6wGapnqSRqbawutKhoKllpJ66prjIp5w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jocko-sims-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jocko Sims - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./overbearing-mom-instructions.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>6 Pages of Baby Instructions</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
