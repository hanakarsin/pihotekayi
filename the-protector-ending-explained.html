Since its debut in 2018, fans have been invested in the Turkish drama, which centers around shopkeeper-turned-powerful-protector Hakan Demir (Çağatay Ulusoy) and his group of Loyal ones as they try to defeat the Immortals aka the bad guys.</p><p>Ahead of the fourth and <a href=#>final season of The Protector,</a> there were many loose ends that needed to be tied up. Did the last seven episodes accomplish what fans were looking for?</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How did The Protector end?</a> We're breaking down how the series concluded, and whether or not good triumphed over evil.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'The Protector's ending explained — who survived the final showdown?</h2><p>In Season 1 of The Protector, Hakan gained powers after he was told to put on a talisman shirt following the death of his adoptive father. He later joined forces with the Loyal Ones, which included Kemal (Yurdaer Okur) and love interest Zeynep (Hazar Ergüçlü), and the group tried to keep Istanbul safe from the Immortals.&nbsp;</p><p>Along the way, Hakan learned that, as the Last Protector, he was the only one who could actually kill the Immortals.&nbsp;</p><p>Faysal (Okan Yalabik) was the only surviving Immortal in Season 1, but he brought back all of the other dead ones after he tried to bring his wife back to life.&nbsp;</p><p>As if this task wasn't intense enough for Hakan and the Loyal Ones, in Season 3, Nisan (Funda Eryigit) emerged. As the Vizier, Nisan was the most powerful Immortal in existence.&nbsp;</p><p>In Season 4, Hakan travels through time to become Harun, and Zeynep crosses over to the Immortal side after taking the cure. With Faysal's blood in her body, she becomes a killer.&nbsp;Vizier also learns that Faysal plotted her killing in the past, and she decides to help Hakan.&nbsp;</p><p>The audience finally discovers why the Immortals are trying to destroy Istanbul in the first place: they cannot return to their own realm until they have ruined the city.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>With the help of Vizier and Okhan, Hakan finally is able to provide the mortality potion to almost all of the Immortals. But, he's no match for Faysal, who didn't take it because he recognized the smell.</p><p>He kills Faysal and decides to sacrifice himself, thereby effectively saving the city.&nbsp;</p><p>In the final moments of the series, it is revealed that Hakan is back to working at his adoptive father's shop. He also is reunited with Zeynep, and the two finally get a happy ending together after seasons of having a will-they-won't-they romance.&nbsp;</p><p>Though there was a lot of resolution that needed to get done in the fourth season of The Protector, all of the major storylines concluded in a way that will likely please fans — especially those that shipped the Zeykan romance. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why is 'The Protector' ending?</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official Twitter account</a> for The Protector confirmed on June 17 that Season 4 would be the last season for the Turkish fantasy series.&nbsp;</p><p>"The struggle is ending.
