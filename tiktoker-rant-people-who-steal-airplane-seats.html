Sometimes it's a <a href=#>screaming baby</a> and other times it's that person in front of you who just had to recline their seat just a little too far back. You can't trust anyone.</p><p>While someone may look all nice and friendly while sitting at the gate and waiting to board, they could be a complete menace once the plane takes off.</p><p>That said, one woman just shared a hell of a story regarding one of the worst plane passengers you can encounter: the seat stealer.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">TikTok creator rants about people who steal your seat on planes.</h2><p>In a <a href=#>TikTok</a> video, a woman named Chelsea (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@chelseazeferenzia)</a> recalled the time that she was taking a redeye flight from San Francisco to New York. She said she specifically booked a window seat so she could sleep (smart lady!), but when she got to her seat, she saw it was taken by somebody else.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@chelseazeferina href=#>@chelseazeferina</a><p><a title=stitch href=#>#stitch</a> with @destinyiriss the audacity <a title=travelstory href=#>#travelstory</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - CHELSEA ✨🍓🌞" href=#>♬ original sound - CHELSEA ✨🍓🌞</a></figure><p>“I get to my row and there is a man in my seat with his hoodie over his eyes pretending to be asleep,” she exclaims into the camera.</p><p>Chelsea then explains that she tapped him on the shoulder and informed him that he was in her seat, to which he asked her “Do you mind if I sit here? I was supposed to be in the middle seat but I don’t want to sit there."</p><p>Of course, understandably, Chelsea said no and asked him to move.</p><p>The good news is that he did it without causing a scene. The bad news is that he decided to act like a baby for the remainder of the flight.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Window seats are the best — just look at his smile! It should be illegal to try and take that happiness away from someone.</p></figure><p>“He gets all huffy puffy and moves his stuff to the middle seat, she said, adding: "He's mad the entire flight.” While her story ended there, Chelsea just couldn't believe his behavior.</p><p>“The audacity to just sit there and pretend that you’re sleeping and then get mad when I ask for my seat that I booked and paid for. People are crazy,” she says as the video ends.</p><p>In the comment section, literally, everyone agreed with Chelsea. "I am constantly blown away by the audacity of people who feel they are entitled," read one comment. "Why is it so difficult to pick your seat when you book? I don’t get it," read another.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>One user even offered Chelsea some advice if it ever happened again. "Let a flight attendant handle it so he can be mad at them," they wrote.</p><p>Unfortunately, sometimes flight attendants are the ones asking people to move from seats they paid for in advance, as other commenters noted.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: toktok</span></figure><p>"Want a laugh?" shared user Candaceinbrooklyn. I paid for an extra leg room seat. Boarded, sat down. Flight attendant comes and says, 'You will be uncomfortable sitting here."</p><p>Why was that? Turns out, the flight attendant wanted her to "switch seats with a 'Medallion' member that was irate he had a seat be the bathroom. The audacity."</p><p>Obviously, there's not much you can do it a flight attendant asks you to move your seat. That said, word of advice: follow the rules. Don't steal seats. Period. Or rather <a href=#>period ahh</a>!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbaswM6knKtlopa7tXnPnqappJVixKm7jKyrnpmcYq6qvs%2BlmKedXaiyosDS</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nicholas-hoult-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nicholas Hoult - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1545732-video-davido-finally-fulfills-promise-hotel-worker-shows-10k-received-singer-cash-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Video As Davido Finally Fulfills Promise to Hotel Worker, She Shows Off $10,000 Cash She Received Fr</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
