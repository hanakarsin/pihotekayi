Zamfara visit: PDP exhibiting ignorance, says Presidency</h2><p>The Presidency on Sunday has lambasted the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) for allegedly exhibiting lack of understanding of Presidential movement schedules despite its 16-year run of the federal government.</p><p>The Presidency was reacting to the PDP’s criticism of President Muhammadu Buhari’s inability to keep date with his scheduled visit to Zamfara State last week Thursday, owing to bad weather.</p><p>The PDP had made an issue out of the cancellation of the Zamfara visit despite the explanation by the Presidency why it was not practicable, suggesting that the President chickened out for security reasons, adding that he could have traveled by road to meet up with the visit.</p><p>However, in a statement by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, in Abuja on Sunday, the Presidency lamented the trivialisation of the role of opposition politicking by the PDP, noting that its criticism on the Zamfara cancelled visit was either borne out of mischief or ignorance.</p><p>Former Governor of Niger State, Babangida Aliyu has revealed why the Goodluck Jonathan administration failed to win the war against insurgency.</p><p>In an interview with The Punch, Aliyu alleged that some Northern politicians frustrated Jonathan’s efforts in curbing the activities of Boko Haram and defeating them.</p><p>He stressed that many northerners misconstrued Jonathan’s position on Boko Haram for political purposes and made it impossible for the proper implementation of policies that would defeat the insurgents.</p><p>The PDP chieftain argued that banditry was impossible during the Jonathan era, adding that banditry started during the Muhammadu Buhari government and has escalated in recent times.</p><p>Aliyu, however, slammed the Northern governors for failing to implement policies that would have defeated banditry.</p><p>The Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC) has debunked rumours that it has concluded plans to replace Babajide Sanwo-Olu with Hakeem Muri-Okunola as the Lagos State Governor in 2023.</p><p>GAC in a statement over the weekend signed by its secretary, Alhaji Mutiu Are said it has not discussed the issue of a second term for Governor Sanwo-Olu neither does the group possess the powers to determine who the next Lagos State Governor will be.</p><p>Naija News reports GAC is the highest decision-making organ of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC in Lagos, and Muri-Okunola is the incumbent Head of Service in Lagos State.</p><p>Following some reports that the body has chosen another person to become the next Lagos State Governor in 2023, the group has urged members of the public to deny such reports, stating that some unscrupulous politicians are the ones spreading such rumours.</p><p>It added that Governor Sanwo-Olu is performing creditably well and should be allowed to focus on governance as he still has some time left of his first tenure.</p><p>Former Niger-Delta militant leader, Asari Dokubo has challenged the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to do its worst over the lingering face-off between them.</p><p>Dokubo in a live Facebook session on Sunday said IPOB is not capable of doing anything against him, adding that the entire Igbo people will soon rise up against the group.</p><p>While denying any hand in the repatriation and legal tussle between IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu and the government, Dokubo went ahead to question the process IPOB as a group is following in its agitation for the creation of an independent Biafra.</p><p>Naija News recalls earlier, IPOB in a statement through its spokesperson, Emma Powerful had submitted that Dokubo is not an Igbo man nor does he understand the Biafra agitation.</p><p>The group, therefore, told him to stop portraying himself as such, warning that if any harm comes the way of any of its members, or its leader, Nnamdi Kanu, then Dokubo will realize the capability of IPOB.</p><p>But the ex-militant leader has told the pro-Biafra group that he knows nothing about their leader’s repatriation to Nigeria and that the people do not love Kanu.</p><p>He added that the southeast region obeys the IPOB sit-at-home order not because of respect for the group or its leader but due to fear of dying.</p><p>A former chairman of the anti-corruption agency in Kano State, Barrister Muhyi Magaji Rimingado, has dumped the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the People Democratic Party (PDP).</p><p>Naija News reports that the suspended Chairman of the Kano State Public Complain and Anti-Corruption Commission made this known in an interview with Kano Focus.</p><p>Rimingado said he joined the opposition PDP to serve the people and the state, adding that the party is the only viable alternative that can salvage the state from the current political mess.</p><p>The suspended anti-graft agency stressed that the PDP as a repositioned party will cleanse the political mess in the state ahead of the 2023 governorship election.</p><p>He noted that he has submitted an online application to join PDP while he is expected to formally register at his ward in Rimingado Local Government Area in February.</p><p>A former governor of Zamfara State, Alhaji Abdulaziz Yari alongside Senator Kabiru Marafa have met with former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and immediate past Senate President Bukola Saraki.</p><p>Naija News reports that the meeting between the political heavyweights was held on Thursday night at Saraki’s Maitama, Abuja, residence.</p><p>According to sources who spoke to The Nation, the meeting may be connected with the rumoured defection plan of the two APC chieftains.</p><p>Recall that the two APC chieftains had a few weeks back meet with Saraki in what Marafa described as a social interaction.</p><p>Naija News reports that Yari and Marafa presently lead two different factions in the Zamfara Chapter of the APC, opposed to that of Governor Bello Matawalle.</p><p>Yari and Marafa have been having a running battle with the national leadership of the APC in recent times.</p><p>Vice President Osinbajo has said that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) would remain committed to the welfare of the average Nigerian.</p><p>Osinbajo made this submission when he played host to a delegation of the APC Professionals Forum at the State House, Abuja, on Friday.</p><p>In a statement by his spokesman, Laolu Akande, the vice president added that the ruling party will continue to serve the people and give them reasons to believe in a better country.</p><p>Osinbajo further stated that the APC is determined to ensure the country’s further growth and development, saying that the party will meet the hopes and expectations of millions of Nigerians.</p><p>Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State has said he told former Vice President Atiku Abubakar not to contest the 2023 presidential race.</p><p>Naija News reports that Mohammed made the submission on Friday when a Contact and Consultation Committee he set up for his presidential ambition submitted its report to him.</p><p>The Bauchi governor said Atiku is too old and tired to lead the country, asking the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain to support his ambition to become President in 2023.</p><p>The governor, however, promised to support the former vice president if he emerges the party’s flagbearer and Nigerians prefer him to other aspirants.</p><p>Mohammed said he will not give the governorship seat to hold forth, saying that he will manage the presidential campaign with the running of the state.</p><p>He, therefore, opined that all the presidential aspirants from all the sections of the country are eminently qualified, so they should be left to discuss with each other.</p><p>The National Caretaker Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) will meet this week to zone all party offices ahead of its national convention.</p><p>A member of the CECPC told THISDAY on Saturday that the caretaker committee would also set up a zoning committee to address the issue of the zoning of the party’s elective positions.</p><p>He said that the expected zoning committee would be guided by equity, justice and fairness by ensuring that all zones and states are fairly represented.</p><p>The APC chieftain said the caretaker committee would play the dual role of the NWC and the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party and approve the zoning arrangement before implementation.</p><p>Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo has berated desperate politicians from the North making moves to retain power after the tenure of President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.</p><p>In a statement signed by Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, its Secretary-General, Ohanaeze warned that such moves by these politicians will sink the country.</p><p>The group berated those working against the gentleman pact of the rotational presidency between the North and South in 2023.</p><p>They urged the north to voluntarily hand over power to the south for the interest of peace and stability, “except if they have decided to set the nation ablaze and sink it.”</p><p>Ohanaeze stated that owners of Nigeria craftily designed policies and procedures to enslave Igbos politically and economically, stressing that this is pushing the people of the Southeast out of Nigeria.</p><p>According to the group, only 2023 Igbo Presidency will assuage the perceptions that Igbo are still part of Nigeria.</p><h2><strong>Those are the top Nigerian newspapers headlines for today.
