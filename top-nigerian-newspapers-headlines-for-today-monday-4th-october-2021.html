style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Good morning Nigeria, welcome to Naija News roundup of top newspapers headlines in Nigeria for today, Monday, 4th October 2021</h2><p>Unknown gunmen on Sunday attacked and burnt down the police and the Department of State Services offices in Nnewi, Anambra State.</p><p>According to witnesses, the attack occurred on Sunday afternoon around 1:00 p.m.</p><p>It was gathered that when hoodlums stormed the offices, they overpowered personnel and set fire to the facilities.</p><p>“The attackers said they don’t want to see any Nigerian flag standing in the area,” a witness told Peoples Gazette.</p><p>The Director-General, Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Salihu Lukman, has asked the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Presidency to stop being passive and reactive to national issues.</p><p>Lukman stated that passive response from both institutions allows the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to portray the APC and President Muhammadu Buhari in bad light despite their achievements.</p><p>In a statement on Sunday, the APC chieftain added that the PDP and other critics of the President were taking advantage of the federal government to achieve their negative objectives.</p><p>Senator Ali Ndume (APC-Borno South) has stated that President Muhammadu Buhari needs to speak more to Nigerians.</p><p>Ndume, the Senate Committee Chairman on Army, stated that Nigerians cannot rely on hearing from Buhari’s media aides, Garba Shehu and Femi Adesina.</p><p>He urged Buhari to hold daily or weekly briefings with Nigerians to update them on measures taken to combat Boko Haram, ISWAP, bandit terrorists, and other criminals across the country.</p><p>Ndume stated that nobody is asking Buhari to take up arms and lead the fight against terrorists but he has to do more as the president of the country.</p><p>The Elders Advisory Council of the All Progressives Congress in Oyo State, has revealed why former President, Goodluck Jonathan can’t be president on the platform of the party.</p><p>The chairman of the council, former Governor of Oyo State, Adebayo Alao-Akala, noted that the ruling party had presidential aspirants within the party already.</p><p>Akala stated this while speaking on Agidigbo 88.5 FM in Ibadan.</p><p>The former governor, however, stated that Jonathan is free to join the party but should not expect to be the flag bearer of the party in the 2023 general elections.</p><p>The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has berated President Muhammadu Buhari over the conditions imposed to lift the suspension of Twitter operations in the country.</p><p>Recall that in June, the Federal Government suspended Twitter’s operation days after a tweet by the president was deleted by the microblogging platform.</p><p>Following the suspension, SERAP and 176 concerned Nigerians filed a suit before the Community Court of Justice, Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) challenging the federal government’s decision.</p><p>On Friday, Buhari had in his Independence Day speech, said that the suspension placed on Twitter will be lifted only if some conditions are met to allow the citizens to use the platform for positive engagements.</p><p>But in a statement on Sunday by its deputy director, Kolawole Oluwadare, SERAP asked the government to withdraw the conditions imposed on the lifting of Twitter suspension pending ECOWAS court verdict.</p><p>SERAP noted that the conditions serve as an interference with the suit before the ECOWAS court and are “unreasonable”.</p><p>The proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has warned elder statesman, Chief John Nwodo, to stop linking the group with the recent killings in the South East.</p><p>Naija News reports that the former President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo was quoted to have accused IPOB of being behind the recent attacks in Anambra and Imo states.</p><p>In a statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, IPOB challenged Nwodo to provide evidence that it was behind the killings in Anambra and Imo states.</p><p>IPOB alleged that Nwodo has lost relevance in the affairs of Ndigbo and Nigeria since his exit as the President-General of Ohaneze Ndigbo.</p><p>The outlawed group urged the Igbo leader to explain if it was IPOB that killed Dr Chike Akunyili and also attacked the convoy of Chris Azubogu, the lawmaker representing Nnewi North, Nnewi South and Ekwusigo Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives.</p><p>A former National Secretary of the Labour Party, Dr Kayode Ajulo has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to name and prosecute sponsors of terrorism.</p><p>Naija News reports that the legal practitioner was reacting to Buhari’s Independence Day nationwide broadcast.</p><p>The president had during the broadcast accused sponsors of separatist agitations of abandoning their national leadership positions for their selfish gains.</p><p>He disclosed that a member of the National Assembly has been identified as a sponsor of the separatist agitation.</p><p>According to Buhari, this came to light following the arrests of the leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, and Yoruba nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, alias Igboho.</p><p>Reacting while speaking with PUNCH, Ajulo asked the president to deal with the terrorism financiers decisively.</p><p>While commending the president for his Independence Day speech, the lawyer noted that it is important to identify sponsors of insecurity in our midst.</p><p>The former Labour Party stalwart asked Buhari to name, apprehend and make sure terrorism financiers face the full weight of the law.</p><p>A former Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Professor Attahiru Jega has blamed Nigerian politicians for the footdragging on adopting electronic transmission of election results in the country.</p><p>The former INEC boss observed that the politicians don’t want electronic transmission because it will expose their selfish propaganda.</p><p>Jega who lambasted politicians in such a category, however, added that the traditional way of transmitting election results is already outdated and Nigeria must adopt the latest technology which can improve the credibility of its electoral processes.</p><p>He made his mind known during a recent national political summit in Abuja under the aegis of the National Consultative Front (NCF).</p><p>The Senate Committee Chairman of the Nigerian Army, Senator Ali Ndume, has stated that the Nigerian military is overwhelmed with battles on many fronts.</p><p>Ndume, a lawmaker representing Borno South in the National Assembly, lamented the audacity of bandit terrorists to attack military formations in the northwest.</p><p>He stated that in the northeast, Boko Haram terrorists took the fight to military formations.</p><p>“They attacked barracks and dislodged military formations. The military had to withdraw from those areas. As I speak, the Bama Barracks has not been rebuilt. The situation in Mongonu is still the same.</p><p>“There are so many formations that were dislodged. There are countless times that the military formations have been attacked,” he told the SUN in an interview.</p><p>Enugu-born housemate, Hazel Oyeye Onou, better known as Whitemoney has been declared winner of the Shine ye eye edition of the Big Brother Naija reality show!</p><p>Popular Nigerian TV host Ebuka Uchendu announced him as the winner on Sunday, 3rd October during the grand finale of the show.</p><p>With the announcement, he clinches the N90Million grand prize which comprises N30 million cash price, an apartment from Revolution Plus Properties, funded Abeg digital wallet, Bitcoins from Patricia and a top range SUV.</p><p>Liquorose on the other hand emerged as the first runner-up, Pere coming in 3rd place then Cross followed consecutively.</p><h2><strong>Those are the top Nigerian newspapers headlines for today.
