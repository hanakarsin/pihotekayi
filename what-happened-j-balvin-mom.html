But <a href=#>what happened to J Balvin's mom?</a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It was the last thing to occur in what was a rollercoaster year for the Medellín native, who at once broke Guinness records for his more than 13 Grammy nominations, collaborated with McDonald's, released his own take on Air Jordans, yet also unfortunately contracted COVID-19 and revealed to the public his ongoing battles with mental health.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to J Balvin's mother?</h2><p>"Oración por mi madre: una cirugía en la cabeza," Balvin posted on his Instagram stories (which translates to "prayers for my mother: a surgery in the head") along with a photo of his mother, Alba Balvin, in a hospital room.</p><p>In the next slide he shared in his stories, the "No Me Conoce" singer wrote in Spanish: "The tests are ongoing. Something very big will come." From what we were able to glean from his social media and other <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">outlets</a>, it appears that his mother, to whom he's famously very close, had to undergo surgery on her head.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, J Balvin harnessed his 45 million followers and asked them to join him in sending Alba prayers and good thoughts for her procedure.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>A few hours into the new year, the Medellín native and Colores crooner thanked his loyal fanbase for their prayers. "Thank you to everyone who prayed for my mother," he wrote in Spanish on his page. "She is out of the most dangerous part, we are awaiting her recovery."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He added: "Thank you for seeing in me a person like any other, that's the only thing I need, nothing more, I'm the same as you."</p><p>J Balvin has revealed before that his mother, who is one of his biggest inspirations and motivations, battles a blood disease — one that she's been fighting for upwards of 40 years. "She keeps fighting, and her and I, we help each other," he told the South American publication <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Semana</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is J Balvin's mom OK?</h2><p>The "Mi Gente" singer spent New Year's Day visiting his mother in the hospital. He recorded another Instagram story where he asks Alba how she is feeling on the first day of the new year.&nbsp;</p><p>"Another testimony that light covers us all," she tells the camera joyfully, while her loving son blows her a kiss.</p><p>Following their visit, Balvin, who cites his mother as his biggest supporter, took the chance to share a moving John Lennon quote on his social media page: "When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down 'happy'. They told me I didn't understand the assignment, and I told them they didn't understand life."</p><p>We wish Alba Balvin all the best in her recovery!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnJZpmapKaeu265zqY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./it-was-difficult-time-for-me-nollywood-actor-opens-on-death-of-40-year-old-son.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'It Was Difficult Time For Me'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./just-in-obaseki-meets-former-apc-chairman-oshiomhole.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Obaseki Meets Former APC Chairman, Oshiomhole</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
