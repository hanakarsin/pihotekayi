He was on the trip with his parents, Jessica Mitchell and DeOrr Kunz Sr., as well as his great-grandfather Bob Walton and Walton’s friend Isaac Reinwand.</p><p>It has been eight years since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Baby DeOrr</u></a>’s disappearance, but there have never been any charges or arrests made in the case. Some details about DeOrr Jr.’s disappearance have left people all over the world scratching their heads and wondering: What happened to Baby DeOrr? Here's the latest update on the mysterious (and saddening) case.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Facebook</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Baby DeOrr?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Lemhi County police</u></a>, Baby DeOrr’s family members called the Sheriff’s Office at approximately 2:35 p.m. on July 10, 2015, saying that DeOrr Jr. had gone missing from their camp about an hour ago.</p><p>In their initial interviews with the media, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Baby DeOrr’s parents</u></a> said they had left their son behind to go explore the area, believing that the child’s great-grandfather would watch over him. “When I come back up to get him, I yelled over to Grandpa, ‘Where’s Little DeOrr?’” DeOrr Sr. said. “He [was] immediately shocked. He says, ‘I thought he came up to you.’” When that happened, the family says they began their own search for the toddler, calling the police shortly thereafter.</p><p>After three days of searching, Baby DeOrr’s parents began to be convinced that their son <a href=#>had been kidnapped</a> rather than simply wandering off into the mountains. In the years since that day, professional volunteer crews have searched the remote campground dozens of times, but have never been able to successfully find any trace of Baby DeOrr.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Facebook</span></figure><p>In June of 2019, nearly four years after DeOrr’s disappearance, police thought they may have had a major break in the case when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>cadaver dogs alerted</u></a> them to possible human remains near the Timbercreek Campground where DeOrr and his family had been staying. However, it appears as though that search has also now led to a dead end.</p><p>The case has been further complicated by a number of tricky details. First, there’s the fact that Baby DeOrr’s family has hired two different private investigators over the past five years, both of whom have quit, citing inconsistencies in the family members’ storylines. One of the investigators, Phillip Klein, has had several lawsuits filed against him for planting false evidence.</p><p>Bob Walton died in the summer of 2019, never having admitted to any knowledge of Baby DeOrr’s location. In 2016, both of DeOrr’s parents were named as suspects in DeOrr’s disappearance, but neither has ever been arrested or charged.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#babydeorr</a> where are you?! 💔🙏 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/HoJNZW1ZGe</a></p>— That1girl@420dogmom (@voiceforyou83) <a href=#>August 17, 2022</a></figure><p>There are many theories of what happened to DeOrr. Some suspect he may have been killed prior to the camping trip. Others theorize either one or both of his parents arranged for an illegal adoption and created the story of his wandering off as a cover-up. It’s also possible that he did actually wander off, even though officials have never found any remains or other evidence to prove he was there.</p><p>Unfortunately, as the case is still ongoing, we don’t know what happened to Baby DeOrr on that July day back in 2015. However, there are thousands of people working (both in a professional and amateur capacity) to <a href=#>solve the mystery</a> of what happened, and holding out hope that he may one day be found.</p><p>Baby DeOrr's grandmother continues to hold tight of her faith that she will soon get answers regarding her grandson's disappearance.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The baby pictured here is DeOrr Kunz, who vanished eight years ago. Holding him here is his grandmother Trina Clegg, who recently said, "I have and will never give up hoping for the answers until the day I die."</p><p>The latest on the search for DeOrr: <a href=#>https://t.co/xxyOjiygt2</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7W3mT0IHfi</a></p>— East Idaho News (@EastIDNews) <a href=#>July 10, 2023</a></figure><p>In July 2023, Trina Clegg, the toddler's grandmother, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">released a statement</a> saying, "Today marks 8 years of this ongoing nightmare. I still have faith and pray for answers everyday. I remember all the great times, laughs and your beautiful eyes and smile. I have and will never give up hoping for the answers until the day I die. I give great thanks to everyone who still helps with looking and keeping positive thoughts and prayers in the name of baby DeOrr."</p><p>Trina continued, "I am eternally grateful for all law enforcement that continues to help seek for the answers to the nightmare at Timber Creek Camp Ground. I love you baby DeOrr today, tomorrow and for eternal!" We hope Baby DeOrr's family can soon find closure!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSbmZKueqWxzqup</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jerry-garcia-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jerry Garcia - Trivia, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./999-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>999 - Members, Ages, Trivia</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
