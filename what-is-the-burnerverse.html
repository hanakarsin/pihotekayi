If that’s gibberish, this article is for you.</p>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jYKDjX hHZJHw">Jamie Lerner</a><p class="sc-bxLYvs cnDLfX">Published June 26 2024, 9:18 a.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter/@jugboij</a></figure><p>This has been the summer of memes between <a href=#>the Hawk Tuah girl</a> and now, Lily Lang.</p><p>For those who have been out of the loop, Twitter has been running rampant with memes and rumors about an SEC college student named <a href=#>Lily Lang</a>, a hot topic in the “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Burnerverse.</a>”</p><p>As the memes gain more and more traction, those who aren’t part of the Burnerverse have a lot of questions.</p><p>For one, what even is this so-called Burnerverse? While millennials have been chronically online most of our lives, we are still a step behind <a href=#>Gen Z</a> and Gen Alpha when it comes to the "memeification" of nearly everything that goes even a little bit viral.</p><p>But don’t worry — we’re here to break it all down, from what the Burnerverse is to what Lily Lang has to do with it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter/@_screenshoter/@stearnsHOF</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The “Burnerverse” is the online universe of fake accounts used to spread information.</h2><p>Back in the old-school days of millennials, we coined the term “burner” to describe a temporary phone or device used for sketchy activities, such as dealing drugs or having affairs.</p><p>In the mid-2000s, the cell phone device wasn’t crazy expensive, especially if it was an old model, and with a temporary calling and texting card, people could easily get burner phones for $20 or less that would be used just a couple of times.</p><p>But nowadays, a burner phone wouldn’t make any sense — if you want a device with communication apps like Whatsapp and iMessage, there aren’t any cheap options. However, social media has opened up in a way that allows people to create “fake” or anonymous accounts.</p><p>Following in the footsteps of their forefathers, the internet has coined the term “Burnerverse” to describe all these temporary, anonymous accounts.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>“Yeah so basically it’s called the burnerverse…. And there was this chick named lily lang, entire SEC had been through her. And the burnerver-“ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Pp3Q3hFHdM</a></p>— Rusty Knotts (@CridneySrosby) <a href=#>June 24, 2024</a></figure><p>However, burner accounts do have some notable differences from burner phones. The biggest difference is that the goal with a burner account is anonymity (to a degree) in order to spread gossip, start social media feuds, and troll on other people’s actual accounts.</p><p>In a way, burner accounts are much more damaging than a burner phone because they can spread far beyond the interaction between two people. Any sentiment shared by a burner account has the capacity to go viral, such as in the case of Lily Lang.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Lily Lang went viral in the Burnerverse because of rumors of infidelity and sex-positivity.</h2><p>If you think the Burnerverse sounds like something incels (involuntary celibates) would take an interest in, you would be right. The account that began the rumors about Lily was named Arthur Cacciatore and had a photo of the Confederate flag as the profile picture.</p><p>“Hey bud….its art here, just wanted to let ya down easy….your uhhh girlfriend? Yeah so she may or may not have had sex with like 35% of the SEC. Solid head tho…stay strong brother,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the account owner wrote</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I honestly feel terrible for this Lily Lang girl. I tend to believe most of these crazy stories that go around on the internet, but this one doesn’t make much sense. I also don’t think any of us should be attacking or making fun of a 18-19 year old girl for having sex in college. <a href=#>https://t.co/mvvmvM1iRs</a></p>— Connor (@23cmcpadres) <a href=#>June 25, 2024</a></figure><p>The tweet and account have since been deleted, proving the temporary nature of the Burnerverse. Even still, Lily’s reputation could be permanently damaged because of the anonymous gossip.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Several Redditors</a> and other internet activists have been quick to point out the hypocrisy that these guys spreading the rumors about Lily are the same ones that would leap into bed with her given the opportunity.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Reddit/r/Frat</a></figure><p>While some believe the rumors, asking why they would target Lily if they aren’t true, we have to disagree. There are plenty of men who spread rumors about women when those women turn them down or make decisions they disagree with.</p><p>Lily is just a freshman at the University of Tennessee who has her entire life ahead of her, and we’re not going to let some dumb SEC Burnerverse ruin her reputation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyiqmasmJp6o8HRp5yrrpWnwKY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./family-halloween-costumes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>21 Of The Greatest Family Halloween Costumes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./northern-group-kicks-against-muslim-muslim-ticket-endorses-lalong-as-tinubus-running-mate.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Northern Group Kicks Against Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Endorses Lalong As Tinubu's Running Mate</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
