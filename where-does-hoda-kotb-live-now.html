However, the routine of one of our favorite co-anchors. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hoda Kotb</a>, hasn't changed much. In fact, she's still reporting live from NBC's 30 Rock in Manhattan every single day. However, when the job is done, she goes home to her <a href=#>fiancé, Joel Schiffman</a>, and two daughters, Haley and Hope. So, where does Hoda live now? <strong>Scroll down for what we know!</strong></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where does Hoda Kotb live now?</h2><p>Hoda Kotb and her family primarily live in an apartment in Upper Manhattan, which is often shown in the background of her social media posts. The location of the space makes it easy for Hoda to commute to work every day.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Newsday,</a> the 55-year-old also bought a four-bedroom, two-and-a-half bathroom waterfront home in Point Lookout, which is on Long Island, N.Y., a few years back, which could be where she escapes to on the weekends.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>On Hoda's Instagram account, we often get to see photos of her abode where she spends time with her family. The space looks cozy and welcoming, and in a previous interview, she admitted that it's a bit chaotic, which is totally relatable to the rest of us!&nbsp;</p><p>"I’m in my apartment looking at my kitchen, and it’s revealing. Every cabinet door is open and has been since the last time I needed something inside," she joked during a 2016 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a>.</p><p>"In this drawer: two old BlackBerry phones, a turkey baster, an old checkbook. Is that a driver’s license? Yes — expired in 2013," Hoda added. "I could win Let’s Make a Deal with this drawer. I think I’m just wired to be disorganized."</p><p>However, amid the COVID-19 spread, it seems Hoda and her family have been staying at their weekend home, she just revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People.</a> In fact, she's waking up more than an hour earlier than her normal time to commute into Manhattan for the live broadcasts.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Not pictured: Abby and Rudy’s amazing adventure #basket</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Hoda Kotb</a> (@hodakotb) on Dec 27, 2019 at 1:41pm PST</p></figure><p>But since many of her colleagues are working from home, she doesn't feel at risk at the eerily quiet NBC studio, located in the heart of Manhattan's Rockefeller Center. “I literally get in the car and come in here to an empty building and then get back in the car and go back to my house. I feel like the building’s not sick and it’s empty. So I don’t really feel a risk,” she told the news outlet of her new routine.</p><p>And when she returns home to her loved ones, she's extra cautious in consideration of Joel and Haley, 3, and Hope, 1. “When I get home, I strip, I shower, throw my stuff right in the wash,” Hoda explained. “Because you’re in the city and sometimes you have to go to a grocery store to pick up something, it seems like the safest idea.”&nbsp;</p><p>For now, it seems Hoda is balancing her commitment to Today as well as enjoying quality time at home with her loved ones. In fact, her Easter Sunday doubled as a first birthday party for their daughter Hope this year, and we were lucky enough to have gotten to see <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">adorable photos</a> from the home celebration!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmm6ido2K1sLDAZqKorJJiuarCxGalqK8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ginny-lemon-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ginny Lemon - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./popular-rccg-pastor-joins-edo-2024-governorship-race-to-succeed-obaseki.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Popular RCCG Pastor Joins Edo 2024 Governorship Race To Succeed Obaseki</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
