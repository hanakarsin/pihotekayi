She toured with Derek Hough this past summer.</h2><p>The ballroom champion made quite the impression on World of Dance judge, Derek Hough. After working together on his “Natural” video, Daniella told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dance Network</a> that Derek asked her to join him on his Live! Tour.</p><p>“I was a little hesitant because I am still competing. I compete with my husband, who is also my partner. Basically, we had to weigh out a lot of things. It was difficult, but then again, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” she said in the interview. “You're not going to get many of these opportunities and competitions will always be there.”</p><p>She added, “You can't really say no to it, you know? And Derek is amazing, so it's a great experience.” Most recently, Daniella showed off clips of her dance moves from the tour, captioning the video, “Last night I had the honor of performing at the Macy’s 4th of July Spectacular with @derekhough and these gorgeous dancers.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here’s how Daniella and her now-husband Pasha met.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Dance Spirit</u></a>, the pro-dancer and her beau met when she was 15 years old. “My coaches warned me that because I was so young and he was a top dancer in the finals already, people might not respect us as a compatible pair,” she explained in regard to their seven-year age difference. Eventually, the two went on to win numerous national championships — and each other’s affection.</p><p>Yes, Pasha and Daniella are married. The couple tied the knot in 2014 and recently celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary in July. “Happy Anniversary @pashapashkovofficial I love you more than peanut butter, and Cheetos,” she captioned a series of pictures. “You are my happiness and I couldn’t picture life without you. To many more adventures, ‘Hulu and chills,’ Wine dates on the beach, and appreciating each other.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">You should definitely follow Daniella on Instagram.</h2><p>If you stalk the dance pro on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Instagram</u></a> (like we did), you’ll see that she regularly posts pics with her hubby. Though, the blonde beauty initially did not think the two would ever end up together.&nbsp;</p><p>"It is funny, because my mom, just before [we tried out together], was asking: 'What if you start liking him. What if you start having feelings for him?' And I was like, 'No way, he is so old! It's never going to happen,'" she confessed.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll also catch Daniella posting dance videos, behind-the-scenes clips from her competitions and shows, and snaps of her travel diaries.&nbsp;Basically, we're already rooting for her this season!</p><p>Catch the Season 28 premiere of Dancing With the Stars on Monday, Sept. 16 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZJ2Znp6yrbjAZqKaqpGcrqS0jJ2uras%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./president-buhari-reacts-as-gov-makinde-confirms-senator-balogun-as-new-olubadan.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>President Buhari Reacts As Gov.
