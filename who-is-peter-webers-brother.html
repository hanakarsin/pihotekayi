We got to know his parents, Barbara and Peter Sr., as they renewed their vows on the premiere episode. While we saw Peter's brother, we didn't get to know him as much as we would have liked.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who is Peter Weber's brother?</a> Jack Weber is the only sibling of Season 24's lead. Read on to find out how he's similar to Peter in more than just the looks department, and to learn about his relationship status.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Peter Weber's brother?</h2><p>Viewers were first introduced to Peter's younger brother during his hometown date with Hannah Brown on The Bachelorette. He took the future DWTS winner aside and pleaded with her not to break Peter's heart (and we all know how that turned out). The sweet interaction got the support of much of the internet, making fans all the more excited when Peter was announced as the lead for the next season.&nbsp;</p><p>Jack is Peter's younger brother by four years, and the two are staples on each other's respective Instagram pages. It's clear how close their bond is, which is probably further solidified by the fact that both still live at home with their parents.</p><p>The younger Weber brother is a 2017 graduate of UCLA, and he chose a postgrad career that is in line with much of his family.</p><p>Peter has spoken on the show about how he was inspired to become a pilot because he saw as a child how much his dad loved being one. It seems like this had a similar influence on Jack as well since he is also a commercial jet pilot.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The brothers both work for Delta Airlines (though Peter was on hiatus while appearing on the ABC shows). Like Peter, Jack also has a plane-centric Instagram handle: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">JettinJack</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Being the supportive older brother that he is, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Peter congratulated Jack</a> for "completing his first solo" flight back in December of 2017.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Jack Weber single?</h2><p>Though his older brother is searching for love on the ABC reality series, Jack Weber is not on the market. He is in a relationship with brand expert Kristine Bruun-Andersen.&nbsp;</p><p>Kristine attended the University of Arizona for her undergraduate degree in journalism. She then went on to get her masters at the University of Southern California. She is now based in Santa Monica like her pilot beau.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Found myself a real Catch</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Jack Weber</a> (@jettinjack) on Oct 5, 2019 at 9:18pm PDT</p></figure><p>The two have been an item since at least October 2019, when they both posted their first Instagram together. In the months since they got together, they have posted many photos together.
