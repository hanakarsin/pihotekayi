Which 'Perfect Match' Season 2 Couples Are Still Together? (SPOILERS)</h1><p class="sc-hUhoKJ ieqoZy">Season 2 of 'Perfect Match' features several strong couples, but the big question remains: Will their relationships survive outside of the villa?</p>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jhDJkI eZknfg">Allison DeGrushe</a><p class="sc-ensa-Dq fPmIpI">Jun. 14 2024, Published 3:01 a.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p><strong>Spoiler alert: This article contains spoilers from Season 2, Episodes 1-9 of </strong><strong>Perfect Match.</strong></p><p>Believe it or not, we're already speeding toward the Season 2 finale of <a href=#>Perfect Match</a>. The long-awaited <a href=#>second season</a> has formed quite a few strong couples, but let's face it — it seems like many of them won't last outside the show's bubble.</p><p>As Episode 9 wraps up, several unexpected couples are confirmed for the finale — but are any of them still together? Here's everything we know so far.</p><h1>Who is still together from Season 2 of 'Perfect Match'?</h1><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Harry Jowsey and Jessica Vestal</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Ana Blumenkron/Netflix</span></figure><p>Perhaps the most talked-about couple in Season 2 of Perfect Match, <a href=#>Harry and Jessica</a> have been an item since Episode 3. However, their relationship has been plagued by trust issues. Not only do other girls speak negatively about Harry to Jessica, but at the men's mixer, Harry becomes overly friendly with the other ladies.</p><p>Later on, Melinda accuses Harry of kissing her multiple times at the mixer and even claims that Harry expressed a desire to "f--k her" and have children with her. If that isn't a red flag, we don't know what is!</p><p>At the time of writing, it's unclear whether Harry and Jess leave the villa as a couple. If they do, we think it's safe to assume they are no longer together.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Chris Hahn and Tolú Ekundare</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Ana Blumenkron/Netflix</span></figure><p>In the fifth episode, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tolú</a> unexpectedly couples up with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris</a> after he reveals his crush on her. Their transition from friends to lovers is gradual, but they appear genuinely invested in each other.</p><p>However, during the men's mixer, Chris voices doubts about the strength of his connection with Tolú. This leaves the Trust: A Game of Greed winner feeling upset as Chris expresses interest in exploring relationships with other women.</p><p>Yet, in Episode 9, this dynamic duo decides to couple up again, seemingly determined to become this season's "perfect match." As of now, it remains unknown whether Chris and Tolú are still together.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Stevan Ditter and Alara Taneri</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Ana Blumenkron/Netflix</span></figure><p>Arguably the strongest couple in the house, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stevan</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alara</a> have been together since Episode 3, and it appears that nothing — not even their respective dates with Brittan and Nigel in Episode 7 — will tear them apart.</p><p>While their current relationship status is a total mystery, it would be surprising if Stevan and Alara ended their relationship. They seem genuinely committed to each other, but the distance between them — Stevan is from California and Alara lives in Wales — may have posed challenges.</p><p>At the moment, Alara follows Stevan on Instagram, but he doesn't follow her back... quite interesting, don't you think?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Kaz Bishop and Christine Obanor</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Ana Blumenkron/Netflix</span></figure><p>At the men's lively mixer, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaz</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christine</a> really hit it off. In Episode 9, following one final argument with his longtime match, Micah, Kaz officially cuts ties with her and instead pairs up with Christine for the night.</p><p>While their chemistry is undeniable, will Kaz and Christine's connection survive beyond the villa? Only time will tell — but a quick scroll on social media reveals that they don't follow each other on Instagram. This could mean two things: They are keeping their relationship under wraps, or things didn't end well between them.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Micah Lussier and Izzy Zapata</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Ana Blumenkron/Netflix</span></figure><p>Despite a cringe-worthy encounter in the first episode, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Micah</a> and <a href=#>Izzy</a> reconnect at the mixer, where Micah confides in Izzy about her tumultuous relationship with Kaz.</p><p>Upon returning to the villa, Micah witnesses Kaz making out with Holly, leaving her utterly devastated. To make matters worse, Kaz pairs up with Christine. Despite feeling she can't stay in the house with Kaz coupled up, Micah decides to stay and matches with Izzy. Their relationship appears to be more about securing a spot in the finale than forming a genuine connection, so it's doubtful they leave the villa as a couple.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Elys Hutchinson and Bryton Constantin</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Ana Blumenkron/Netflix</span></figure><p>After chatting it up with <a href=#>Bryton</a> at the women's mixer, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elys</a> finds herself unable to shake him from her thoughts. As a result, she abruptly ends her long-standing relationship with Justin Assad and instead couples up with the <a href=#>Squid Game: The Challenge</a> star.</p><p>However, it seems their relationship doesn't last long because <a href=#>Bryton is currently dating Jade Gentile</a>, a WWE NXT superstar better known by her ring name Jazmyn Nyx. They've posted about each other on Instagram, and the wrestler has even made a story highlight solely for Bryton on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her profile</a>.</p><p>Perfect Match is now streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKysmaG5bsDOoJytoJWnerGx0Z%2BcnKxdoq61r8dmqp6Zo6S7bn4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cassie-and-colton-drama.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cassie Randolph and Colton Underwood Drama, Restraining Order</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pdp-primaries.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Read All The Latest News About PDP primaries On Naija News</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
