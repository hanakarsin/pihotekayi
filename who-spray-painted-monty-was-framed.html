With the fourth and final season drawing the Liberty High series to a close, we're still left with some questions.</p><p>Like, <a href=#>who spray-painted "Monty was framed" on the school walls</a>? Clearly, someone was in on the fact that Monty was not responsible for Bryce's death. Keep reading for answers, and inevitably, some spoilers.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: DAVID MOIR/NETFLIX</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who spray-painted "Monty was framed" in '13 Reasons Why'?</h2><p>Back in Season 3, Monty (Timothy Granaderos) was serving time in prison for sexually assaulting Tyler (Devin Druid), but then was killed by an inmate at the end of the season. Because he's dead, it was convenient to pin Bryce (Justin Prentice)'s death on Monty.</p><p>Of course, the road that leads to the mystery of Bryce's death is a long one, as many people were seen arguing or physically fighting with him at the homecoming dance. Even <a href=#>guilt-ridden Zach (Ross Butler)</a>, who confessed to the murder after beating him up to a pulp, is actually innocent — as it's, in fact, Alex who pushed him into the river, where he was unable to help himself because of all of his injuries.</p><p>But we might not even know to suspect any of the other students of Bryce's murder if it hadn't been for the spray-painted message, reading "Monty was framed" in red letters at school.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Yup.

It turns out that it was also Clay who broke into the school one night and smashed security cameras, and that he was caught on camera setting a car on fire, which led to a dangerous blast.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, and how could anyone forget the time when he snatched an officer's gun and scared everyone at school?</p><p>In short, Clay has some work to do to better his mental state. But it seems like he's finally been putting in the effort, and by the end of the season, he seems ready to set off for a life at Brown University.</p><p>Viewers are left with hope after his moving speech at graduation where he addresses all the hardships he's been faced with at Liberty. And when the friends make a pact to always be there for each other <a href=#>if anyone texts "Gordon Lightfoot,"</a> it seems they've got their heads on straight.</p><p>Binge all four seasons of 13 Reasons Why on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwedKpqZqxXaWuqrrTnptmpZ%2Bjwbp51pqqZp6ilrqmsA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./457760-i-started-dating-paul-at-18-p-squares-wife-reveals-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'I Started Dating Paul At 18 '- P Squares Wife Reveals</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./402298-tanzania-familia-yawapoteza-jamaa-4-chini-ya-muda-wa-siku-28-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tanzania: Familia yawapoteza jamaa 4 chini ya muda wa siku 28</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
