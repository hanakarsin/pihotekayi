Let's find out.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why did RGIII get fired by ESPN?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Athletic</a>, RGIII was fired by ESPN as part of a cost-cutting strategy, with the network approaching the end of its fiscal year in September. The 2012 Pro Bowler was reportedly earning over seven figures.</p><p>The first indication that RGIII was leaving ESPN came when he was removed from Monday Night Countdown, the prime pregame show he had been part of for two years. During this year's offseason, ESPN hired former Eagles center Jason Kelce to take his place.</p><p>Shortly after 3 p.m. EST on Aug. 15, RGIII took to X (formerly Twitter) and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> a clip from the movie Friday, seemingly commenting on the news. The brief video features the character Willie Jones asking, "How the hell you gon' get fired on your day off?!"</p><p>Later that same day, RGIII <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared</a> a lengthy post confirming his departure from ESPN.</p><p>"Thankful for so many people in my time at ESPN that helped me grow because they are some of the best in the business," he wrote on X. "From the broadcast booth to the studio and ESPECIALLY the people many of you never see behind the camera.</p><p>"They are the REAL MVPs and sacrifice so much time with their families just to ensure people like myself in front of the camera even have the opportunity to shine." He added, "There were so many awesome experiences and moments that my family and I will never forget from the last three years."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aql562qnnGnqtmnpmnsqV5wbJknqugow%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ngx-access-gtb-fidelity-bank-tops-equity-as-investors-trade-1-731bn-shares-in-five-days.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Access, GTB, Fidelity Bank Tops Equity As Investors Trade 1.731bn Shares In Five Days</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./vikram-chauhan-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Vikram Singh Chauhan - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
