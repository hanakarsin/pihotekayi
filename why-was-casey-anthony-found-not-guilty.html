When the verdict was read, the crowd outside of the courthouse erupted in anger. Most of them were clutching protest signs calling Anthony a baby killer or worse. Many people felt the evidence against her was overwhelming and yet she walked free.</p><p>Why was <a href=#>Casey Anthony</a> found not guilty?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>People protest the Casey Anthony verdict outside of the Orange County Courthouse on July 7, 2011</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why was Casey Anthony found not guilty?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a> reported that the jury deliberated for 10 hours and 40 minutes before reaching their verdict. As each was read followed by a "<a href=#>not guilty</a>," Anthony grew increasingly more emotional, finally bursting into tears and hugging her defense team. The defense's only job was to introduce reasonable doubt to the jury.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, immediately after the trial, one juror provided some insight about the decision-making process.</p><p>"Generally, none of us liked Casey Anthony at all," he told the outlet. "She seems like a horrible person. But the prosecutors did not give us enough evidence to convict. They gave us a lot of stuff that makes us think she probably did something wrong, but not beyond a <a href=#>reasonable doubt</a>."</p><p>Disturbingly enough, this same juror revealed that the perceived attitudes of lead prosecutor Jeff Ashton versus lead defense attorney <a href=#>Jose Baez</a> played a part in the "not guilty" verdicts. That should not be the case. While Ashton seemed "arrogant" and "cold," Baez seemed genuinely invested in this case.</p><p>"He was the only one in the room who seemed to care," said the juror. Evidently this was discussed in the jury room. At the end of the day, there was simply no concrete evidence linking Casey Anthony to the death of her daughter.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Casey Anthony go to jail?</h2><p>Although she received three "not guilty" verdicts for the more serious charges, Anthony wasn't let off completely. She was found guilty of "four <a href=#>misdemeanor counts</a> of providing false information to law enforcement," per CNN. "Judge Belvin Perry sentenced Anthony to four years in jail — one year for each of her four convictions of lying to police — but with credit for the approximately three years already served and good behavior, her release date was set for next Wednesday, July 13," reported the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anderson 360 blog</a>.</p><p>She was officially released from the Orange County Jail in Orlando in the early morning on July 17, 2011.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Casey Anthony leaves the Orange County Jail with her attorney, Jose Baez, on July 17, 2011</p></figure><p>Not only was Casey fined $1,000 for each misdemeanor count, but she was ordered to pay "nearly $98,000 for the costs of investigating Caylee's disappearance," said CNN. She was later ordered to pay an additional $119,822.25 to the police. In July 2013, a judge tossed out two of her convictions, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">citing double jeopardy as the reason</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Some members of the jury regretted their decision.</h2><p>Jennifer Ford told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a> that the decision to acquit Anthony made them feel "sick to their stomachs." They knew they just didn't have enough to convict her. "I did not say she was innocent," said Jennifer to ABC News. "If you cannot prove what the crime was, you cannot determine what the punishment should be."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>It always came down to a lack of evidence, as it should, but everyone felt in their guts that Anthony was guilty. Most wished that they weren't on the jury at all as the experience changed their lives forever.</p><p>In 2018, People reached out to the 12 members of the jury and not a single one wanted to talk. "It happened seven years ago, and still everyone asks about it," one told the outlet. "At this point, what more is there to say?"</p><p>Apparently, Casey Anthony feels differently.
