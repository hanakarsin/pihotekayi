Though many popular streamers have been switching platforms, leaving <a href=#>Twitch</a> for its shiny new competitor <a href=#>Kick</a>, Ninja doesn't confine himself to one platform. Instead, he streams across multiple platforms, letting his fans watch him on whatever platform they prefer.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Ninja via Instagram</a></figure><p><a href=#>TikTok</a> has slowly become a more popular place for streamers to play games. Despite the restrictions of the vertical, phone-sized screen, plenty of gamers have grown their own followings by <a href=#>streaming live on the app</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, it seems that one of Ninja's recent streams has gotten him banned from TikTok live — but what happened on the stream to get him banned?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ninja replicated the "Glizzy Overdrive" meme on TikTok live, resulting in his ban.</h2><p>If you're not chronically on TikTok and up to date with every trend and meme that crosses your For You page, I envy you. But that also probably means you missed the recent influx of NPC livestreams. Creators would go live and pretend to be an NPC, reacting to gifts from viewers, and sometimes even doing sexually explicit gestures if gifted a specific sticker.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’m so confused? How do they ban you for eating hot dogs????</p>— Sparkles_qt (@sparkles_qt) <a href=#>September 12, 2023</a></figure><p>Through this trend, some creators started doing a "<a href=#>glizzy overdrive</a>" motion, imitating eating hotdogs quickly as viewers gifted them the hotdog sticker.</p><p>Of course, this motion can sometimes look sexually explicit, especially as the creators dramatize the motion.</p><p>During one of his streams, Ninja also decided to jokingly do the "glizzy overdrive" motion — and not long after, he was banned from streaming live on TikTok.</p><p>“I violated community guidelines, dude…” he said. “Let me get this straight. A guy can dress up as a hot dog and literally suck glizzies for like four hours straight, but I impersonate him one time and I’m banned in the first 30 seconds?”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>TikTok banned my live for doing this… <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YeGDbCFU6K</a></p>— Ninja (@Ninja) <a href=#>September 12, 2023</a></figure><p>Unfortunately, Ninja did not elaborate on how long his ban is in place for, so it's unclear how long his viewers will have to go before they can stream his lives on TikTok again. That said, TikTok live bans aren't usually in place for very long, and since this seems to be Ninja's first offense, he'll likely be back in good standing within a couple of days.</p><p>Despite the ban, it seems that Ninja is relatively unbothered by the temporary ban, laughing about it with his followers in the replies. In fact, his followers also think that the ban was unnecessary — especially considering there are multiple creators who do the same thing often in their livestreams.</p><p>"I’m so confused? How do they ban you for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">eating hot dogs</a>????" one fan replied, while another wrote "They should have to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">runnin ads</a> for hotdog companies with that perfect form."</p><p>Regardless, Ninja has plenty of other platforms you can watch him stream on if you don't want to miss any of his content.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6edaaqmammaO3onnBmqWnnZRiwaq306iiZqSZq7I%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./obasanjo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Read All The Latest News About Obasanjo On Naija News</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./snl-vp-debate-skit.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Maya Rudolph Steals Show as Kamala Harris</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
