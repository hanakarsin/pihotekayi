Ultimately, she found that her sacrifices were work went unnoticed as she lost her job anyway and she would much rather work a lower-stress job that didn't take a toll on her mental health or dig into her time with loved ones.</p><p>The TikToker speaks into the camera in a video that she records from her car: "I was part of the recent massive IT corporate layoff and like many of us I was a top performer that got let go with no notice."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@suburbconvert href=#>@suburbconvert</a><p>Went from making 115k to $15/hr.

I brought my laptop and worked because I felt like that would be rewarded in the end."</p><p>She learned that this wasn't the case as she ended up becoming part of legions of tech layoffs that occurred in 2023. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TechCrunch</a> reports that some 168,243 employees were let go from businesses that included Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and many others.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @suburbconvert</span></figure><p>@suburbconvert continued to say that folks who have managed to hold onto their good jobs should learn to set boundaries as she wishes she did so, citing that her dedication to the job ultimately didn't prevent the proverbial axe from falling on her.</p><p>"All this is to say that if you are still employed...set boundaries. What are they gonna do, fire you? If you don't set boundaries they're firing you anyways. And if you are a layoff victim, first of all I'm sorry, and second of all, go get you a $15 job rolling burritos."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @suburbconvert</span></figure><p>She then points to her own Chipotle work uniform as she says this. "If you're fortunate enough to be able to afford that luxury — do it. It's worth it, your mental health and your life is not worth the salary of accomplishment of a 'career'."</p><p>In a caption for the video, @suburbconvert writes that she seems to prefer working in a fast-casual restaurant versus big tech as she lives a more stress-free existence when compared to her previous position, and she urged individuals to care less about succeeding in the "career" of their dreams and to put more stock into their mental health instead.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @suburbconvert</span></figure><p>"Went from making 115k to $15/hr.
