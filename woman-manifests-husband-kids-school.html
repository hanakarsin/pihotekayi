Hoping to see this hot dad that I believed to be single after I did a lot of scouting. And I never got a chance to connect with him but the school was like tired of hearing me talk about him to them, like the aftercare."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@dailydoseofdorilee href=#>@dailydoseofdorilee</a><p><a title=stitch href=#>#stitch</a> with @Jackie Gansky <a title=strategic href=#>#strategic</a> <a title=interested href=#>#interested</a> <a title=perfectman href=#>#perfectman</a> <a title=husbandmaterial href=#>#husbandmaterial</a> <a title=howwemet href=#>#howwemet</a> <a title=waitforthegreats href=#>#waitforthegreats</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Dorilee" href=#>♬ original sound - Dorilee</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @dailydoseofdorilee</span></figure><p>She continued, explaining how her vocalization and what sounds like a thinly veiled expression of interest in the man to others eventually got her hooked up with the dude: "And so it was the last day of school before summer break and they're like hey Dorille we're gonna give him your phone number."</p><p>That's right, the aftercare school staff decided to wingman it for her and finally get Dorilee in contact with the "hot dad" she had been crushing on all school year. "And then I actually saw him on the way out and I was like oh hi, total verbal diarrhea, like no pickup lines, no nothing here, and...I actually thought I scared him."</p><p>That first encounter she had with the "hot dad" wasn't something that instilled her with the most confidence, but her initial assessment of her interaction with the man was actually not as bad as she thought.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @dailydoseofdorilee</span></figure><p>"But he went inside and they gave him my phone number and then he texted me and I was like oh I hope this means that you're single and then he realized who I was and he's like yes I am single I think we should get together I was like oh I like that. And we, that was on Wednesday, and we had our first date on Saturday of that week," she says, smiling as she plays with her hair, remembering the details of that initial week when first contact was broken.</p><p>"And then 111 days later we got married, we eloped in the woods," she says, showing off a ring to the camera. "Yeah, so I hung out at my kids' school and really annoyed the people who ran the aftercare so much that they were, they were like, okay Dorilee," she said, commenting on the playful frustration they must've felt seeing her obviously crushing on this man.</p><p>"We can have you be bummin' all summer so we're gonna give him your phone number and they did. Like Ethan gave him my phone number and then he messaged me and then over the summer though, the cool part over the summer...we saw Ethan, I did, and he was like oh whatever happened with that, I was engaged."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @dailydoseofdorilee</span></figure><p>She then described how she broke the news to the aftercare school worker, Ethan, and that they weren't making their engagement known to everyone at first.</p><p>"But I hid it because I wanted Sean to be there and I was like oh you know like we went out a couple of times he seems pretty cool, on the first day of school we went to go pick up all three of our kids together...who were in the aftercare and he was like oh, what?"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @dailydoseofdorilee</span></figure><p>Dorilee went on, holding up her ring, "And we were like Ethan! And he's like shut up! And now I think they should make a dating service, yeah, but just hang out at your kids' school," she says, laughing at the end of the video before it ultimately closes out.</p><p>Several TikTokers who responded to the clip expressed how happy they were to hear Dorilee's story, commenting that the glee she felt while relaying her tale was evident: "Wowwwww you manifested your husband," one person wrote.</p><p>Another quipped: "aftercare was DONE WITH YOU. congrats! lol"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @dailydoseofdorilee</span></figure><p>There were some folks, however, who expressed that they thought 111 days is way too short of a time for people to know each other before they're married: "Girl not even a year later following for the drama to come," one person wrote.</p><p>However, Dorilee responded, "Absolutely no drama. There is not a person in our lives who doesn't believe we weren't made for each other."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mpJqmmZuytMDSZp%2Buq5KWu6V5yqKbrGWjmLWwu8s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./apc-national-chairman-sani-musa-declares-interest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>APC National Chairman: Sani Musa Declares Interest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-security-agencies-havent-deployed-force-against-bandits-buhari.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Security Agencies Havent Deployed Force Against Bandits</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
