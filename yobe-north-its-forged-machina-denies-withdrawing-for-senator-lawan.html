I am by this letter also informing you of my withdrawal from the Yobe North Senatorial race.</p><p>“These decisions was taking due to my personal reasons related to misunderstanding between I and the leadership of the APC in Yobe State. It’s my hope to reconcile the issues in close-door but unfortunately I was not opportune to made it.</p><p>“It’s my pleasure to use this medium to thank all my supporters for your solidarity and love.</p><p>“I wish to thank you personally for your graciousness and leadership. I also wish you best of luck in service to the party.”</p><p>Reacting to the letter, Machina stated that it was forged as he never at any time resigned from the party nor withdrew from the race.</p><p>He said; “It is brought to my notice that some unscrupulous elements have forged my withdrawal letter out of mischief and blackmail.</p><p>“I want to state unequivocally that the purported letter was forged. I did not at anytime withdraw nor resign from my party.</p><p>“I was shocked when I discovered that some persons concocted plans to mislead the public, particularly my supporters, into believing that I have withdrawn.</p><p>“The discrepancies between the two dates expecially between the date of writing the purported letter and the date it was receipt exposed the authors inadequacies and lack of sufficient administrative knowledge.</p><p>“Although we suspect that this letter may be another fake news and the hand work of enemies of peace, yet the APC’s National secretariat must speak up on it since it is carrying the official stamp of the secretariat.</p><p>“For the avoidance of doubt, I have not resigned nor withdrawn my candidature, I am in APC and have no intention to move to any party. I will (insha Allah) pursue my senatorial ambition on the platform of the All Progressives Congress.</p><p>“I have already instructed my lawyers to review the fake letter and take necessary legal actions against the culprit(s)”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e49tZrKnkpp6r7vRrZ9moaSoeqe70aCcnWWdlrCptc2aZJ2dnp6ytHnWoquhnKKWxKq6xmadqKpdqLKvrdOoqWakkayur3s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./august-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>August Horoscope | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./300830-top-25-curvy-women-instagram-2020-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Top 25 curvy women on Instagram 2020</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bobby-brown-html.html>Bobby Brown (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-faac-shares-n907-054-billion-june-2023-revenue-to-fg-states-and-lgas.html>FAAC Shares N907.054 Billion June 2023 Revenue To FG, States And LGAs</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./65062-html.html>Journalists Barred From Attending National Conference Sittings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./398958-teacher-dazzles-social-media-users-stunning-photos-fans-fear-students-html.html>Netizens fear for students after photos of their voluptuous teacher emerged online</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-appeal-court-sacks-apcs-senator-ishaku-abbo.html>Appeal Court Sacks APC's Senator Ishaku Abbo</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkVlog.
